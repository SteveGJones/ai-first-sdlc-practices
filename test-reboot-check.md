# Agent Deployment Reboot Test

**Purpose**: Test if agents deployed to `.claude/agents/` become available after Claude session restart

## Current Status
- Agent deployed: `.claude/agents/simple-test-agent.md` ✓
- Immediate availability: NO ✗
- After restart: NOT TESTED

## Test Protocol

### Step 1: Verify Current State
The file `.claude/agents/simple-test-agent.md` should still exist from our earlier test.

### Step 2: Request User to Test
After this conversation ends and a new one begins:
1. Try: `@simple-test-agent hello`
2. Expected if it works: "Deployment successful at [timestamp]"
3. Expected if it fails: "I don't have access to simple-test-agent"

### Step 3: Document Results
Update this file with findings.

## Why This Matters
If agents ARE available after restart:
- Changes deployment strategy from "doesn't work" to "works with restart"
- Update documentation to reflect this
- Modify agent installer to note restart requirement
- Consider pre-deployment strategies

## Test Agent Content
For reference, the test agent should respond with:
"Deployment successful at 2025-08-01T14:35:00"

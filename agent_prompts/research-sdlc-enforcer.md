# Deep Research Prompt: SDLC Enforcer Agent

## Objective

Research and compile the domain knowledge required to build an AI sub-agent
that acts as an SDLC Enforcer. This agent will enforce software development
lifecycle compliance, validate process adherence, check project health,
gate work behind quality standards, and ensure teams follow established
development practices.

## Research Areas

### 1. SDLC Process Enforcement (2025-2026)
- What are current best practices for SDLC process enforcement?
- How do organizations balance enforcement strictness with developer productivity?
- What are the latest patterns for automated SDLC compliance checking?
- How should enforcement adapt to different project types (prototype, production, enterprise)?
- What are current patterns for policy-as-code in SDLC enforcement?

### 2. Quality Gates & Checkpoints
- What are current best practices for quality gates in software development?
- How should gate criteria be defined for different lifecycle stages?
- What are the latest patterns for automated gate checking in CI/CD?
- How do organizations implement pre-commit, pre-push, and pre-merge gates?
- What are current patterns for gate bypass and exception handling?

### 3. Process Compliance Automation
- What are current best practices for automating compliance checks?
- How should branch protection, PR requirements, and commit standards be enforced?
- What are the latest patterns for documentation compliance verification?
- How do organizations automate retrospective and proposal requirement checks?
- What are current patterns for compliance monitoring dashboards?

### 4. Level-Based Enforcement
- How should enforcement differ by project maturity (startup vs enterprise)?
- What are current patterns for progressive enforcement levels?
- How do organizations define and assess project compliance levels?
- What are the latest patterns for level-up criteria and assessment?
- What are current patterns for customizable enforcement profiles?

### 5. Developer Experience in Enforcement
- How should enforcement tools communicate issues to developers?
- What are current best practices for actionable enforcement feedback?
- How do organizations reduce friction in compliance workflows?
- What are the latest patterns for auto-fix and remediation suggestions?
- What are current patterns for enforcement tool integration with IDEs?

### 6. Continuous Compliance Monitoring
- What are current best practices for continuous compliance monitoring?
- How should compliance drift be detected and corrected?
- What are the latest patterns for compliance trend analysis?
- How do organizations set up compliance alerting and notification?
- What are current patterns for compliance reporting to leadership?

## Synthesis Requirements

After completing the research, synthesize findings into:

1. **Core Knowledge Base**: SDLC processes, quality gates, enforcement patterns, compliance automation the agent must know
2. **Decision Frameworks**: "When enforcing [standard] at [level], use [approach] because [reason]"
3. **Anti-Patterns Catalog**: Common enforcement mistakes (blocking without explaining, one-size-fits-all, ignoring context)
4. **Tool & Technology Map**: Current enforcement and compliance tools with selection criteria
5. **Interaction Scripts**: How to respond to "check our compliance", "set up quality gates", "enforce standards"

## Agent Integration Points

This agent should:
- **Coordinate with**: enforcement-strategy-advisor on adoption strategies
- **Hand off to**: compliance-auditor for comprehensive audits
- **Receive from**: team-progress-tracker for compliance metrics
- **Collaborate with**: github-integration-specialist on repository enforcement
- **Never overlap with**: compliance-auditor on audit conduct and reporting

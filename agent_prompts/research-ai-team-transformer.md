# Deep Research Prompt: AI Team Transformer Agent

## Objective

Research and compile the domain knowledge required to build an AI sub-agent
that acts as an AI Team Transformer. This agent will coach teams on AI-first
development practices, transform solo developers into effective AI team
coordinators, run practical training exercises, and build AI team collaboration
skills through hands-on challenges.

The resulting agent should be able to assess team AI readiness, design
transformation programs, run coaching exercises, diagnose collaboration
anti-patterns, and measure team transformation progress when engaged by
the development team.

## Context

This agent transforms how teams work with AI agents, moving from solo
developer mindset to team-of-agents orchestration. The existing agent has
creative training exercises but needs depth on organizational change
management research, adult learning theory for technical skills, effective
coaching methodologies, and metrics for measuring AI team effectiveness.

## Research Areas

### 1. AI-Augmented Team Dynamics (2025-2026)
- How are high-performing teams integrating AI agents into their workflows?
- What research exists on human-AI team collaboration effectiveness?
- What are the latest patterns for AI-assisted pair/mob programming?
- How do teams balance AI automation with human creativity?
- What organizational structures support AI-first development teams?

### 2. Change Management for AI Adoption
- What are current best practices for organizational AI adoption?
- How do change management frameworks (ADKAR, Kotter) apply to AI transformation?
- What are the common resistance patterns when adopting AI tools?
- How should organizations measure AI adoption success?
- What are current patterns for phased AI tool rollouts?

### 3. Developer Coaching & Training
- What are current best practices for coaching developers on new practices?
- How do adult learning principles apply to AI tool adoption?
- What are the latest patterns for hands-on exercises and deliberate practice?
- How should training programs balance theory with practical application?
- What are current patterns for measuring skill development over time?

### 4. AI Collaboration Anti-Patterns
- What are common anti-patterns in human-AI collaboration?
- How do teams identify and correct over-reliance on AI?
- What are the latest patterns for maintaining code quality with AI assistance?
- How should teams handle AI tool limitations and errors?
- What are current patterns for AI tool governance in teams?

### 5. Team Assessment & Metrics
- What metrics indicate effective AI-augmented team performance?
- How should organizations measure developer productivity with AI tools?
- What are the latest patterns for AI adoption maturity models?
- How do DORA/SPACE metrics apply to AI-augmented development?
- What are current patterns for continuous improvement in AI team practices?

### 6. Multi-Agent Coordination Skills
- How should developers learn to coordinate multiple AI agents effectively?
- What skills differentiate AI team orchestrators from solo AI users?
- What are the latest patterns for agent delegation and supervision?
- How should teams design agent interaction workflows?
- What are current practices for agent team retrospectives and optimization?

## Synthesis Requirements

After completing the research, synthesize findings into:

1. **Core Knowledge Base**: Team dynamics, change management, coaching methods, assessment frameworks the agent must know
2. **Decision Frameworks**: "When team exhibits [behavior pattern], apply [coaching technique] because [reason]" structured guidance
3. **Anti-Patterns Catalog**: Common AI team mistakes (hero syndrome, AI over-reliance, prompt-and-pray, no review process, skill atrophy)
4. **Tool & Technology Map**: Current AI collaboration tools, metrics platforms, and training resources with selection criteria
5. **Interaction Scripts**: How to respond to "transform our team to AI-first", "we struggle with AI coordination", "measure our AI adoption", "train our team on AI tools"

## Agent Integration Points

This agent should:
- **Complement**: sdlc-enforcer by focusing on human skills (enforcer handles process compliance)
- **Hand off to**: sdlc-enforcer for process enforcement after transformation
- **Receive from**: delivery-manager for team performance concerns
- **Collaborate with**: agile-coach on team dynamics and retrospectives
- **Never overlap with**: sdlc-enforcer on technical compliance checking

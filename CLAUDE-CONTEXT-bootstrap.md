**THE DEFINITIVE BOOTSTRAP GUIDE FOR AI AGENTS**

When you see "BOOTSTRAP MODE" or detect a fresh AI-First SDLC installation, this is your complete operational manual. Follow these instructions exactly to ensure successful project initialization.

## üö® Bootstrap Detection Indicators

You are in BOOTSTRAP MODE when you see ANY of these:
- Files contain `[Your Project Name]` or `[Description]` placeholders
- Architecture documents are empty or contain only template content
- No feature proposals exist in `docs/feature-proposals/`
- User mentions "setting up" or "initializing" the framework
- Validation errors about incomplete architecture documents
- Fresh project with basic directory structure but no real content

## üéØ Bootstrap Objectives

Your PRIMARY GOALS during bootstrap:
1. **Create Complete Project Foundation** - All required documents with real content
2. **Enable Immediate Development** - Team can start working on first feature
3. **Establish Quality Standards** - All processes work from day one
4. **Ensure Compliance Readiness** - Pass intermediate validation immediately

## üìã Bootstrap Checklist Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Assessment & Setup (5-10 minutes)

**1.1 Verify Bootstrap State**
```bash
# Check if this is truly a bootstrap situation
ls docs/feature-proposals/     # Should be empty
ls retrospectives/            # Should be empty
ls plan/                      # Should be empty
cat templates/architecture/*  # Should contain [placeholders]
```

**1.2 Gather Project Information**
Ask the user EXACTLY these questions (if not provided):
- "What is the primary purpose of this project in one sentence?"
- "What programming language(s) will you primarily use?"
- "What type of application is this (web app, API, CLI, mobile, etc.)?"
- "Who are your main users (developers, end users, admins, etc.)?"
- "What's your target deployment environment (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)?"

**1.3 Run Official Setup (if not done)**
```bash
# Only if setup-smart.py hasn't been run
python setup-smart.py "[project description]" --non-interactive --ci-platform github
```

# Failure Mode Analysis - E-Commerce API

## Critical System Failures

### Database Connection Loss

| Failure Mode | Database Primary Becomes Unavailable |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Probability** | Medium (2-3 times per year) |
| **Impact** | High (All write operations fail) |
| **Detection Time** | < 30 seconds (health check failure) |
| **Recovery Time** | 2-5 minutes (automatic failover) |

**Symptoms**:
- Connection timeout errors
- 500 Internal Server Error responses
- Health check endpoint returns unhealthy

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Automatic failover to standby database
- Connection pool retry with circuit breaker
- Graceful degradation to read-only mode
- Customer notification via status page

### Payment Gateway Timeout

| Failure Mode | Stripe API Response Time > 30 seconds |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Probability** | Low (Monthly during peak events) |
| **Impact** | Medium (Payment processing delayed) |
| **Detection Time** | 30 seconds (timeout threshold) |
| **Recovery Time** | Immediate (retry mechanism) |

**Symptoms**:
- Payment confirmation delays
- User frustration with checkout process
- Increased customer support tickets

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement exponential backoff retry
- Queue failed payments for batch processing
- Show progress indicator to users
- Webhook reconciliation for missed events

### High Traffic Overload

| Failure Mode | Request Volume Exceeds 10,000 RPM |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Probability** | High (During sales events) |
| **Impact** | High (Site becomes unresponsive) |
| **Detection Time** | < 1 minute (metrics alerting) |
| **Recovery Time** | 5-10 minutes (auto-scaling) |

**Symptoms**:
- Response times increase beyond 2 seconds
- HTTP 503 Service Unavailable errors
- Customer complaints on social media

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaling
- CDN caching for static content
- Rate limiting per user/IP
- Emergency traffic shaping rules

## Data Integrity Failures

### Order State Inconsistency

| Failure Mode | Order Status vs Payment Status Mismatch |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Probability** | Medium (Due to async processing) |
| **Impact** | High (Financial/Legal implications) |
| **Detection Time** | 15 minutes (reconciliation job) |
| **Recovery Time** | Manual review required (30-60 min) |

**Prevention**:
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Idempotent operation design
- Event sourcing for audit trail
- Automated reconciliation jobs

### Inventory Overselling

| Failure Mode | Negative Stock Levels in Database |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Probability** | Low (Race condition during high demand) |
| **Impact** | High (Customer service issues) |
| **Detection Time** | Real-time (database constraint) |
| **Recovery Time** | Immediate (transaction rollback) |

**Prevention**:
- Database-level inventory constraints
- Optimistic locking for stock updates
- Pre-order validation checks
- Real-time inventory monitoring

## Security Failures

### Authentication Bypass

| Failure Mode | JWT Token Validation Failure |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| **Probability** | Low (Code defect or attack) |
| **Impact** | Critical (Unauthorized access) |
| **Detection Time** | Variable (Depends on monitoring) |
| **Recovery Time** | Immediate (Patch deployment) |

**Detection Mechanisms**:
- Anomaly detection on access patterns
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring

## üîÑ Post-Bootstrap Workflow

Once bootstrap is complete, the team follows standard AI-First SDLC:

1. **Feature Development**: Create feature proposals before implementation
2. **Architecture Updates**: Update architecture docs when adding new patterns
3. **Quality Maintenance**: All validation must continue to pass
4. **Progress Tracking**: Use retrospectives and implementation plans
5. **Continuous Compliance**: Regular audits and quality reviews

## üÜò Bootstrap Troubleshooting

### Issue: Architecture validation fails with "incomplete content"
**Solution**: Check for remaining template placeholders, ensure all sections have project-specific content

### Issue: Requirements matrix seems artificial or generic
**Solution**: Interview user about actual project needs, create requirements based on real user stories

### Issue: Unable to identify external integrations
**Solution**: Ask about authentication, payments, email, monitoring, deployment - most projects have several external dependencies

### Issue: What-if analysis scenarios seem contrived
**Solution**: Focus on realistic business scenarios: growth, technology changes, budget constraints, regulatory requirements

Remember: Bootstrap is about creating a SOLID FOUNDATION. Take the time to do it right - it will save weeks of technical debt and confusion later.

# AI-First SDLC Quick Start

## For Users: How to Get Claude to Set Up This Framework

### Step 1: Open your project in Claude

Navigate to your project directory where you want to implement AI-First SDLC practices.

### Step 2: Give Claude this prompt

```
Please set up the AI-First SDLC framework from https://github.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices in this project.
```

Claude will ask you: "What is the purpose of this project?"

You can then respond with something like:
- "building a REST API with FastAPI"
- "creating a React web application"
- "developing a CLI tool in Python"
- "implementing a machine learning pipeline"

### Step 3: What Claude will do

1. Download the setup script from the framework
2. Run it with your project purpose
3. Create necessary directories and files
4. Set up CI/CD configuration
5. Attempt to configure branch protection

### Step 4: When Claude needs your help

Claude may ask you to:

- **Authenticate GitHub CLI**: Run `gh auth login` in your terminal
- **Choose CI/CD platform**: Select from the list Claude provides
- **Grant admin access**: For branch protection setup

### Step 5: Verify setup

After setup, Claude will run verification and show you:
- ‚úÖ What was successfully configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è What needs manual attention
- üìã Next steps for development

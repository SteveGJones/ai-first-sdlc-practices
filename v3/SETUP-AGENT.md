# SETUP-AGENT.md - v3 AI-First SDLC Pure Agent Installer

## Activation

When user says any variation of "Setup AI-First SDLC", "Install SDLC framework", or "Setup v3", respond:

```
üöÄ AI-FIRST SDLC v3 SETUP INITIATED
Pure agent installation - Zero scripts, zero dependencies
Analyzing your project...
```

Then immediately begin setup without asking questions.

## Your Capabilities

You are the SETUP-ORCHESTRATOR with complete autonomy to:
1. Analyze any project structure
2. Make all setup decisions
3. Create all necessary files
4. Configure all integrations
5. Deploy specialist agents

## Setup Protocol

### Phase 1: Project Analysis
```python
# Pseudocode for your mental model
def analyze_project():
    scan_files = list_all_files()
    tech_stack = detect_technologies(scan_files)
    complexity = assess_complexity(scan_files)
    team_size = infer_team_size()

    return {
        'type': determine_project_type(tech_stack),
        'complexity': complexity,
        'technologies': tech_stack,
        'recommended_agents': select_agent_team(tech_stack, complexity)
    }
```

### Phase 2: Configuration Creation

Based on analysis, create these files:

#### CLAUDE.md (Project Instructions)
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md - AI-First SDLC v3

This project uses AI-First SDLC v3 - Pure agent-based development.

## Project Configuration
- Type: [detected type]
- Stack: [detected technologies]
- Complexity: [assessed level]
- Team Size: [inferred size]

## Active Agents
[List specialized agents based on project needs]

## Compliance Rules
- Zero technical debt tolerance
- Mandatory team-first approach
- Architecture-first development
- Continuous validation

## Knowledge Base
Access patterns and procedures:
https://github.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices/v3/knowledge/
```

#### .github/workflows/ai-sdlc-v3.yml
```yaml
name: AI-First SDLC v3 Compliance

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  compliance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Agent Validation
        run: |
          echo "Activating VALIDATION-AGENT..."
          echo "Checking architecture documents..."
          echo "Verifying team-first compliance..."
          echo "Validating zero technical debt..."

      - name: Report
        run: echo "‚úÖ v3 Compliance Check Complete"
```

#### docs/architecture/README.md
```markdown
# Architecture Documentation

All 6 architecture documents required BEFORE code:
1. requirements-traceability-matrix.md
2. what-if-analysis.md
3. architecture-decision-record.md
4. system-invariants.md
5. integration-design.md
6. failure-mode-analysis.md

Templates: https://github.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices/v3/knowledge/templates/
```

### Phase 3: Agent Team Deployment

Based on project type, specify agent team in CLAUDE.md:

#### For Web Applications
```markdown
## Agent Team
- solution-architect (Lead)
- ui-ux-specialist
- api-designer
- test-engineer
- performance-engineer
- devops-specialist
```

#### For Microservices
```markdown
## Agent Team
- solution-architect (Lead)
- integration-orchestrator
- api-designer
- devops-specialist
- monitoring-specialist
- test-engineer
```

#### For CLI Tools
```markdown
## Agent Team
- solution-architect (Lead)
- test-engineer
- documentation-architect
```

### Phase 4: Validation

After creating files, validate:

```markdown
‚úÖ Validation Checklist:
‚ñ° CLAUDE.md created with project configuration
‚ñ° GitHub workflow configured
‚ñ° Architecture templates ready
‚ñ° Agent team specified
‚ñ° Knowledge base linked
‚ñ° Zero dependencies required
```

## Decision Matrix

### Project Type Detection
| Indicators | Classification | Agent Team Size |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| package.json + React | Frontend Web | 5-6 agents |
| server.js + Express | Backend API | 4-5 agents |
| Dockerfile + k8s | Microservices | 7-8 agents |
| main.py + CLI args | CLI Tool | 3-4 agents |
| *.ipynb files | Data Science | 5-6 agents |

### Complexity Assessment
| LOC | Dependencies | Classification | Setup Depth |
|-----|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| <1k | <10 | Simple | Basic |
| 1k-10k | 10-50 | Moderate | Standard |
| 10k-50k | 50-100 | Complex | Comprehensive |
| >50k | >100 | Enterprise | Full Platform |

## Migration from v2

If detecting existing v2 installation (setup-smart.py exists):

```markdown
üîÑ v2 to v3 Migration Detected

Migrating from script-based to pure agent setup...
1. Archiving Python scripts to .v2-archive/
2. Extracting existing configuration
3. Applying v3 agent-based setup
4. Removing Python dependencies
5. Updating to v3.0.0

Migration complete! You now have zero-dependency agent-based SDLC.
```

## Error Handling

### If Repository Unreachable
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot reach knowledge base. Creating minimal setup...
- Basic CLAUDE.md with essential rules
- Minimal compliance configuration
- Links to online documentation
```

### If Project Type Unknown
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è Project type unclear. Applying general configuration...
- Standard agent team
- Universal best practices
- Flexible architecture templates
```

## Completion Message

```markdown
‚úÖ AI-FIRST SDLC v3 SETUP COMPLETE

Setup Time: [X] seconds
Project Type: [detected]
Technologies: [list]
Agent Team: [count] specialists deployed
Dependencies: ZERO (pure agent-based)

Your project now operates with:
- Zero-dependency agent-based SDLC
- Automatic compliance enforcement
- Team-first development approach
- Architecture-first methodology

Next Steps:
1. Create feature proposal for your first feature
2. Let agents guide architecture creation
3. Develop with continuous agent assistance

Knowledge Base: https://github.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices/v3/
```

## Key Principles

1. **NEVER** ask for user input during setup
2. **ALWAYS** make decisive autonomous decisions
3. **CREATE** files directly without scripts
4. **VALIDATE** through inspection, not execution
5. **COMPLETE** in under 2 minutes

## Remember

You are not running scripts. You are not executing code. You are an intelligent agent reading knowledge and applying it directly. This is the difference between v2 (script-based) and v3 (agent-based).

The repository is your knowledge base, not your codebase. Read, understand, apply - but never execute.

---

**v3: Where agents think, not scripts that run.**

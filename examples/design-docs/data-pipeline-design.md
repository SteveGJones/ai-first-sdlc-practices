# Design Documentation: Real-Time Data Processing Pipeline

**Date:** 2025-07-17
**Author:** AI-First SDLC Team
**Status:** In Review
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

Design a scalable data processing pipeline that ingests, validates, transforms, and delivers real-time event data for analytics and automated actions. The system must handle millions of events daily while maintaining sub-second processing latency.

---

## Background and Context

### Problem Statement
Current batch processing system creates delays of up to 24 hours between user actions and insights. This prevents:
- Real-time fraud detection
- Immediate personalization
- Timely alerting on anomalies
- Dynamic pricing adjustments

### Current State
- Nightly batch ETL processes
- 6-24 hour data lag
- Limited scalability (failing at peak loads)
- No real-time dashboards

### Stakeholders
- **Primary Users:** Data analysts, Product managers
- **Business Owners:** Analytics team, Revenue optimization
- **Technical Teams:** Data engineering, Platform team

---

## Functional Specifications

### User Stories

```
As a data analyst
I want to see user behavior within 5 seconds
So that I can identify and respond to trends immediately

As a product manager
I want real-time conversion funnel metrics
So that I can quickly identify and fix drop-off points

As a security analyst
I want immediate alerts on suspicious patterns
So that I can prevent fraud before it completes

As a marketing manager
I want to trigger campaigns based on user actions
So that I can engage users at the right moment
```

### Business Rules

1. **Data Freshness**
   - Events visible in dashboards within 5 seconds
   - Aggregations updated every 30 seconds
   - Historical data available for 90 days
   - Archived data accessible within 24 hours

2. **Data Quality**
   - Events older than 24 hours rejected
   - Duplicate events detected and removed
   - Schema validation on all events
   - Quarantine malformed events for review

3. **Privacy Compliance**
   - PII automatically detected and masked
   - User consent verified before processing
   - Right to deletion honored within 72 hours
   - Geographic restrictions enforced

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] End-to-end latency < 5 seconds for 95% of events
- [ ] System handles 1000 events/second sustained
- [ ] Zero data loss during normal operations
- [ ] Automated recovery from component failures
- [ ] GDPR and CCPA compliant

### Component Descriptions

#### Event Collector
- **Purpose**: Receive and acknowledge events from all sources
- **Responsibilities**: Basic validation, buffering, acknowledgment
- **Interfaces**: HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, WebSocket for streaming
- **Constraints**: Must handle 10k requests/second per instance

#### Schema Validator
- **Purpose**: Ensure events conform to expected structure
- **Responsibilities**: Schema validation, versioning, error reporting
- **Interfaces**: Consumes from message buffer
- **Constraints**: Must not block pipeline, quarantine bad events

#### Data Enricher
- **Purpose**: Add context and derived data to events
- **Responsibilities**: User profile lookup, geolocation, device info
- **Interfaces**: External APIs, internal databases
- **Constraints**: Cache heavily, fail gracefully

## Data Specifications

### Event Schema

```
Event Structure:
├── metadata
│   ├── event_id (UUID)
│   ├── timestamp (ISO 8601)
│   ├── version (semver)
│   └── source (string)
├── user
│   ├── id (hashed)
│   ├── session_id
│   └── attributes (map)
├── context
│   ├── device_type
│   ├── os_version
│   ├── app_version
│   └── location (country/region only)
└── payload
    ├── event_type
    ├── properties (map)
    └── custom_data (json)
```

### Data Retention

| Data Type | Hot Storage | Cold Storage | Deletion |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Raw Events | 7 days | 90 days | Automatic |
| Aggregations | 30 days | 2 years | Automatic |
| User Data | While active | 90 days after | On request |
| Audit Logs | 90 days | 7 years | Policy-based |

## Processing Rules

### Event Validation

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Receive Event] --> B{Schema Valid?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Timestamp Fresh?}
    B -->|No| D[Quarantine]
    C -->|Yes| E{Duplicate?}
    C -->|No| F[Reject - Stale]
    E -->|No| G[Process]
    E -->|Yes| H[Deduplicate]
    H --> G
    D --> I[Alert Ops]
    F --> I
```

### Aggregation Rules

1. **Time Windows**
   - Real-time: 1-minute tumbling windows
   - Near real-time: 5-minute sliding windows
   - Batch: Hourly aggregations

2. **Metrics**
   - Count by event type
   - Unique users per window
   - Conversion funnel stages
   - Revenue attribution

### Alert Conditions

| Alert Type | Condition | Action | SLA |
|------------|-----------|--------|-----|
| Anomaly | >3 std dev from baseline | Notify analyst | <1 min |
| Threshold | Metric exceeds limit | Trigger workflow | <30 sec |
| Pattern | Fraud signature detected | Block + alert | <5 sec |
| System | Component failure | Page on-call | Immediate |

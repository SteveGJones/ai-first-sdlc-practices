# Architecture Decision Record: Checkout Service Architecture

**ADR-ID:** ADR-2024-001  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Architecture Team, Engineering Lead, CTO  
**Technical Story:** Design scalable checkout service for FastCart

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to design a checkout service that can handle 10,000 concurrent users during peak sales, integrate with multiple payment providers, maintain PCI compliance, and provide a sub-2-second response time. The current monolithic architecture cannot scale to meet Black Friday demands and makes PCI compliance difficult.

### Background
- Current system: Monolithic Ruby on Rails application
- Peak load: 10,000 concurrent checkouts expected
- Compliance: PCI DSS Level 1 required
- Performance: 2-second page load requirement
- Timeline: Must be ready for Q4 2024

## Decision Drivers

1. **Scalability**: Must handle 10x current traffic
2. **Security**: PCI compliance without storing card data
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime requirement
4. **Performance**: Sub-2-second response times
5. **Development Speed**: 3-month timeline
6. **Team Expertise**: Current team knows Node.js and Python
7. **Cost**: Budget constraints of $500K
8. **Integration**: Must work with existing systems

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Microservices with Node.js
**Description**: Break checkout into microservices (cart, payment, order, notification)

**Pros:**
- Independent scaling of components
- Node.js expertise on team
- Good ecosystem for e-commerce
- Easy integration with Stripe SDK

**Cons:**
- Distributed transaction complexity
- Network latency between services
- Operational overhead
- Distributed debugging challenges

### Option 2: Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda)
**Description**: Implement checkout as serverless functions

**Pros:**
- Infinite scaling capability
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- No infrastructure management
- Built-in high availability

**Cons:**
- Cold start latency issues
- Vendor lock-in to AWS
- Complex local development
- 15-minute timeout limitations

### Option 3: Modular Monolith
**Description**: Keep monolithic deployment but modular code structure

**Pros:**
- Simpler deployment and debugging
- No network latency between modules
- Easier transaction management
- Lower operational complexity

**Cons:**
- Scaling limitations
- Single point of failure
- Harder to achieve PCI isolation
- Team coordination challenges

### Option 4: Event-Driven Architecture
**Description**: Async processing with event streaming (Kafka)

**Pros:**
- Excellent for handling spikes
- Natural audit trail
- Decoupled components
- Good for analytics

**Cons:**
- Eventually consistent (not ideal for payments)
- Complex error handling
- Steep learning curve
- Additional infrastructure (Kafka)

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Option: Option 1 - Microservices with Node.js

**Justification:**
1. **Scalability**: Each service can scale independently based on load
2. **PCI Compliance**: Payment service can be isolated in secure subnet
3. **Team Skills**: Leverages existing Node.js expertise
4. **Timeline**: Can develop services in parallel
5. **Performance**: Proven architecture pattern for e-commerce

### Implementation Details

```yaml
Services:
  cart-service:
    - Manages shopping cart state
    - Redis for session storage
    - Horizontal scaling

  payment-service:
    - PCI compliant subnet
    - Stripe/PayPal integration
    - No card data storage
    - Idempotency guaranteed

  order-service:
    - Order processing workflow
    - PostgreSQL for persistence
    - Event publishing

  notification-service:
    - Email/SMS notifications
    - Queue-based processing
    - Template management

  api-gateway:
    - Kong or AWS API Gateway
    - Rate limiting
    - Authentication
    - Request routing
```

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Communication**: REST APIs with circuit breakers
2. **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL for orders, Redis for carts
3. **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for async operations
4. **Service Mesh**: Istio for observability
5. **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes on AWS EKS

## Consequences

### Positive
- Each team can own and deploy services independently
- Fault isolation prevents total system failure
- Can use different tech stacks where appropriate
- Easy to scale individual components
- Clear service boundaries aid PCI compliance

### Negative
- Increased operational complexity
- Need for distributed tracing
- Network latency between services
- Distributed transaction challenges
- Higher cloud infrastructure costs

### Risks and Mitigation
1. **Risk**: Distributed transaction failures
   - **Mitigation**: Saga pattern with compensating transactions

2. **Risk**: Cascading failures
   - **Mitigation**: Circuit breakers, timeouts, bulkheads

3. **Risk**: Debugging complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Distributed tracing (Jaeger), centralized logging

4. **Risk**: Data consistency
   - **Mitigation**: Event sourcing for critical operations

## Alternatives Migration Path

If microservices prove too complex:
1. **Short-term**: Combine services into larger services
2. **Medium-term**: Move to modular monolith
3. **Long-term**: Re-evaluate based on actual load patterns

## Validation

### Proof of Concept
- Build payment service first (highest risk)
- Load test with 15,000 concurrent users
- Measure actual vs projected costs
- Security audit of PCI compliance

### Success Criteria
1. Handle 10,000 concurrent checkouts
2. 99.9% uptime over 3 months
3. P95 latency < 2 seconds
4. Pass PCI compliance audit
5. Development completed by October 1

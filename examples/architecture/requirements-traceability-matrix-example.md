## Requirement Sources
- **Business/Sales**: Product requirements document v2.3
- **Customer Support**: Ticket analysis Q1-Q2 2024
- **Legal/Compliance**: Compliance audit report 2024
- **Architecture**: Technical feasibility study
- **Performance Team**: Current system metrics baseline

## Coverage Analysis
- Total Requirements: 17
- Implemented: 0 (0%)
- In Progress: 0 (0%)
- Pending: 17 (100%)
- Test Coverage: 0%

## Risk Items
1. **HIGH**: Stripe API integration complexity (FR-002)
2. **MEDIUM**: Meeting 2-second load time with current infrastructure (NFR-001)
3. **LOW**: Email delivery delays during high volume (FR-005)

## Notes
- All test case IDs reference the test plan document
- Implementation files will be updated as development progresses
- Acceptance criteria are measurable and testable
- Priority levels: MUST (required for launch), SHOULD (important), COULD (nice to have)

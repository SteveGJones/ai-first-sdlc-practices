# What-If Analysis - E-Commerce Checkout System

**Project:** FastCart Checkout System
**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2024-07-25
**Prepared By:** Architecture Team

## Overview
This document analyzes potential edge cases, failure scenarios, and unexpected situations that could impact the checkout system. Each scenario includes probability, impact, and mitigation strategies.

## Critical Path Analysis
The checkout flow critical path:
1. Add to cart → 2. View cart → 3. Enter shipping → 4. Enter payment → 5. Confirm order → 6. Process payment → 7. Send confirmation

Failure at any step prevents revenue generation.

## Scenario Analysis

### Payment Processing Scenarios

#### What if Stripe API is completely down?
- **Probability:** Low (0.01% based on Stripe SLA)
- **Impact:** Critical - No orders can be processed
- **Detection:** Health check endpoint, payment timeouts
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Implement PayPal as backup payment processor
  - Queue orders for delayed processing
  - Show clear messaging to customers
- **Recovery:** Auto-retry queued payments when Stripe recovers
- **Testing:** Monthly failover drill

#### What if a payment is charged but our system crashes before recording the order?
- **Probability:** Very Low
- **Impact:** Critical - Customer charged without order
- **Detection:** Webhook reconciliation, payment/order mismatch alerts
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Implement idempotency keys for all payment operations
  - Use database transactions with payment recording
  - Stripe webhooks as backup recording mechanism
- **Recovery:** Automated reconciliation job every 5 minutes
- **Testing:** Chaos engineering test monthly

#### What if credit card is declined after inventory is reserved?
- **Probability:** Medium (2-3% of transactions)
- **Impact:** Low - Temporary inventory hold
- **Detection:** Payment processor response
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Release inventory reservation after 15 minutes
  - Allow 3 retry attempts with different payment methods
  - Clear messaging about declined payment
- **Recovery:** Automatic inventory release
- **Testing:** Include in regular test suite

### Inventory Scenarios

#### What if two customers buy the last item simultaneously?
- **Probability:** Medium during sales/promotions
- **Impact:** High - Customer satisfaction issue
- **Detection:** Inventory level monitoring
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Pessimistic locking on inventory during checkout
  - Reserve inventory for 15 minutes once in cart
  - "Only X left!" warnings when inventory < 5
- **Recovery:** Offer discount code to customer who missed out
- **Testing:** Load test with concurrent purchases

#### What if inventory system is out of sync with warehouse?
- **Probability:** Low with current system
- **Impact:** High - Overselling products
- **Detection:** Daily reconciliation reports
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Real-time inventory sync with warehouse
  - Safety buffer of -2 items for physical goods
  - Manual override capability for operations team
- **Recovery:** Express shipping at company cost for oversold items
- **Testing:** Quarterly inventory audit

### Performance Scenarios

#### What if Black Friday traffic is 10x normal?
- **Probability:** Certain (happens annually)
- **Impact:** Critical - Lost revenue if site crashes
- **Detection:** Real-time traffic monitoring
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Auto-scaling policies for all services
  - CDN for all static assets
  - Queue system for checkout processing
  - Graceful degradation (disable recommendations)
- **Recovery:** Waiting room system if overwhelmed
- **Testing:** Load test at 15x capacity quarterly

#### What if database performance degrades during checkout?
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** High - Slow checkouts, abandoned carts
- **Detection:** Query performance monitoring, response time alerts
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Read replicas for non-critical queries
  - Redis cache for shipping rates, tax calculations
  - Connection pooling optimization
  - Query timeout limits
- **Recovery:** Automatic failover to read replica
- **Testing:** Database stress testing monthly

### Integration Scenarios

#### What if shipping API doesn't respond?
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium - Can't calculate shipping
- **Detection:** API timeout monitoring
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Cache shipping rates for 24 hours
  - Fallback to flat-rate shipping table
  - Show estimated shipping with disclaimer
- **Recovery:** Recalculate actual shipping post-order
- **Testing:** Include timeout scenarios in integration tests

#### What if tax calculation service returns wrong rates?
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** High - Legal/compliance issue
- **Detection:** Rate change monitoring, anomaly detection
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Sanity check all tax calculations (0% < tax < 20%)
  - Manual override table for known issues
  - Audit log all tax calculations
- **Recovery:** Batch correction capability
- **Testing:** Validate against known tax scenarios

### Security Scenarios

#### What if someone attempts credit card fraud?
- **Probability:** High (1-2% of transactions)
- **Impact:** Medium - Chargebacks, fees
- **Detection:** Stripe Radar, velocity checks
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Integrate Stripe Radar for fraud detection
  - Velocity limits (5 orders/hour per IP)
  - Manual review for orders > $500
  - Block suspicious patterns
- **Recovery:** Chargeback process, blacklist bad actors
- **Testing:** Security audit quarterly

#### What if there's a XSS vulnerability in checkout?
- **Probability:** Low with proper practices
- **Impact:** Critical - Payment data exposed
- **Detection:** Security scanning, CSP violations
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Content Security Policy headers
  - Input sanitization on all fields
  - Regular security scanning
  - Bug bounty program
- **Recovery:** Immediate patching, user notification if needed
- **Testing:** Penetration testing before launch

### Data Scenarios

#### What if customer data is accidentally exposed?
- **Probability:** Very Low
- **Impact:** Critical - Legal, reputation
- **Detection:** Access logs, data leak monitoring
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Encryption at rest and in transit
  - PII data masking in logs
  - Access control and audit trails
  - Data minimization principles
- **Recovery:** Breach notification process
- **Testing:** Security audit, access review quarterly

## Edge Cases

### Customer Behavior
- Customer changes shipping address after payment
- Customer's session expires during payment
- Customer uses expired discount code
- Customer's cart contains discontinued items
- Multiple tabs open with different cart states

### Technical Edge Cases
- Browser crashes after payment but before confirmation
- Network timeout exactly at payment processing
- Clock skew between services causes timestamp issues
- Unicode in addresses breaks shipping API
- Floating point precision issues in tax calculation

## Mitigation Priority Matrix

| Scenario | Probability | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Status |
|----------|-------------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Black Friday traffic | Certain | Critical | P0 | Planned |
| Payment processor down | Low | Critical | P0 | Planned |
| Credit card fraud | High | Medium | P1 | Planned |
| Concurrent last item | Medium | High | P1 | Planned |
| Shipping API timeout | Medium | Medium | P2 | Planned |

## Testing Strategy
1. **Chaos Engineering**: Monthly failure injection tests
2. **Load Testing**: Quarterly at 15x normal capacity
3. **Security Testing**: Penetration tests before major releases
4. **Integration Testing**: All edge cases in automated suite
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Annual DR drill for critical failures

## Monitoring Requirements
- Real-time dashboards for all critical paths
- Alerts for anomalies in payment/order ratios
- SLA monitoring for all external dependencies
- Customer journey analytics for dropout detection
- Error rate monitoring with automatic escalation

## Success Metrics
- < 0.1% failed transactions due to technical issues
- < 2 second response time at 99th percentile
- Zero security incidents
- < 5 minute detection time for critical issues
- < 30 minute recovery time for any scenario

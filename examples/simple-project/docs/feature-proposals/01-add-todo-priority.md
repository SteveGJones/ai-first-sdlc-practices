# Feature Proposal: Add Priority to Todo Items

**Proposal Number:** 01
**Status:** Approved
**Author:** Claude AI
**Created:** 2025-01-12
**Target Branch:** `feature/todo-priority`
**Implementation Type:** Code

---

## Executive Summary

Add a priority field to todo items allowing users to mark todos as low, medium, or high priority, with filtering and sorting capabilities.

---

## Motivation

### Problem Statement

Users currently have no way to indicate which todos are most important. As todo lists grow, users need to focus on high-priority items but cannot distinguish them from routine tasks.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to set priority levels on my todos so that I can focus on what's important
- As a user, I want to filter todos by priority so that I can see only high-priority items
- As a user, I want to sort todos by priority so that important items appear first

---

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Approach

Add an optional priority field to the Todo model with three levels (low, medium, high). Update API endpoints to support setting priority and add query parameters for filtering and sorting.

### Technical Approach

- Add `priority` enum field to Todo model
- Update Pydantic schemas
- Add query parameters to GET /api/todos
- Update database with migration
- Add sorting logic to service layer

## Implementation Plan

### Estimated Effort

- **Complexity**: Low
- **Estimated Time**: 1 day
- **Required Skills**: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Database and Models
- [ ] Add priority field to Todo model
- [ ] Create database migration
- [ ] Update Pydantic schemas

#### Phase 2: API Updates
- [ ] Update POST/PUT endpoints
- [ ] Add query parameters to GET
- [ ] Implement filtering/sorting

#### Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Update API documentation

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can set priority when creating/updating todos
- [ ] GET /api/todos accepts ?priority=high filter
- [ ] GET /api/todos accepts ?sort=priority parameter
- [ ] All tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] API documentation updated

---

## Security & Privacy Considerations

- No security impact (priority is user-specific data)
- No privacy impact (no new PII collected)

---

## Rollout Strategy

- No feature flag needed (backward compatible)
- Existing todos will have null priority (treated as low)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Migration fails | Low | Medium | Test on staging first |
| Performance impact | Low | Low | Add index if needed |

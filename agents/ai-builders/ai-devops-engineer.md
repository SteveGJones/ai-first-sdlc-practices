## Real Examples I Guide

### Example 1: LLM API Deployment
```yaml
# Helping team deploy LLM service
pipeline:
  - test: Prompt regression suite
  - build: Container with model cache
  - deploy: Blue-green with canary
  - monitor: Token usage and latency
```

### Example 2: Agent System Rollout
```yaml
# Guiding multi-agent deployment
strategy:
  - version: Tag all agent versions
  - test: Integration test suite
  - deploy: Staged rollout by region
  - observe: Agent interaction metrics
```

### Example 3: RAG System Operations
```yaml
# Building RAG deployment pipeline
components:
  - embeddings: Version and cache
  - vectordb: Backup and sync
  - inference: Scale based on load
  - monitoring: Relevance tracking
```

## AI DevOps Patterns

### Pattern 1: Model Canary Deployment
```python
# Gradual rollout with monitoring
deploy_canary(
    model_v2,
    traffic_percentage=5,
    success_criteria={
        "latency_p99": "<500ms",
        "error_rate": "<0.1%",
        "quality_score": ">0.9"
    },
    rollback_on_failure=True
)
```

### Pattern 2: Prompt Version Control
```yaml
# GitOps for prompts
prompts/
  â”œâ”€â”€ production/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ agent-v1.2.yaml
  â”œâ”€â”€ staging/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ agent-v1.3-rc.yaml
  â””â”€â”€ tests/
      â””â”€â”€ regression-suite.yaml
```

### Pattern 3: Cost Circuit Breaker
```python
# Prevent runaway costs
cost_monitor = CostCircuitBreaker(
    max_hourly_spend=100,
    max_tokens_per_minute=1000000,
    alert_threshold=0.8,
    shutdown_threshold=1.0
)
```

## The AI DevOps Engineer Manifesto

"I help teams ship AI with confidence - from laptop to production, from prototype to planet-scale. Every pipeline I build handles the unique challenges of AI: non-determinism, cost management, quality assurance, and ethical deployment. I don't just deploy models; I architect operational excellence for AI systems. When teams deploy AI that scales reliably while costs stay controlled, that's DevOps mastery applied to the AI age."

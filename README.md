# AI-First SDLC Practices

A comprehensive framework for integrating AI agents as primary developers while maintaining quality and process compliance.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For AI Agents (Enhanced Branch Protection Education)
Simply tell the AI: 
```
Set up a new project for [purpose] using the AI-First SDLC framework from https://github.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices.

Download and run: python setup-smart.py "[project purpose]"

Then read CLAUDE.md and run the repository health check to verify main branch protection.
```

### For Humans (One-liner Setup)
```bash
# Quick setup with curl (recommended)
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices/main/setup.sh | bash -s -- "building a REST API"

# Or without project purpose (uses default)
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices/main/setup.sh | bash
```

### Alternative: Direct Python Setup
```bash
# If you prefer to download and run manually
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices/main/setup-smart.py > setup-smart.py
python setup-smart.py "building a REST API with FastAPI"
```

Both methods will:
1. Download enhanced CLAUDE.md with branch protection education
2. Set up branch protection using gh CLI (prompts for auth if needed)
3. Create all necessary directories and templates
4. Generate initial feature proposal on ai-first-kick-start branch

### What This Does
1. **Downloads enhanced CLAUDE.md** with branch protection education for AI agents
2. **Creates `ai-first-kick-start` branch** automatically 
3. **Generates project-specific CLAUDE.md** with your project details
4. **Sets up branch protection** using secure gh CLI (prompts for auth if needed)
5. **Creates initial feature proposal** to kickstart the workflow
6. **Configures validation tools** and framework scripts
7. **Provides AI education** on branch protection verification and troubleshooting
8. **Sets up CI/CD** for your platform (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

## üìö Documentation

- [HOWTO Guide](docs/HOWTO.md) - Comprehensive usage guide
- [Quick Reference](docs/QUICK-REFERENCE.md) - Command cheat sheet
- [Workflow Diagrams](docs/workflow-diagram.md) - Visual process flows

## üéØ Core Principles

1. **Mandatory Branch Strategy** - No direct pushes to main
2. **Feature Proposals First** - Document before implementing
3. **Progress Tracking** - Maintain task visibility
4. **Context Preservation** - Seamless handoffs between sessions
5. **Automated Validation** - Ensure compliance continuously

## üõ†Ô∏è Components

### Templates
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI agent instructions
- Feature proposal templates
- Implementation plan templates
- Retrospective templates

### Tools
- **Progress Tracker** - Task management for AI and humans
- **Context Manager** - Preserve state between sessions
- **Validation Pipeline** - 9-point compliance checks
- **Branch Protection** - Automated git configuration
- **Setup Script** - One-command framework installation

### Examples
- Simple project setup
- Multi-agent collaboration
- CI/CD integration

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Git 2.0+
- Optional: pre-commit (for hooks)

## üèóÔ∏è Framework Development vs Usage

### Using the Framework (You're Starting a New Project)
- Run the setup script in YOUR project
- Framework tools are downloaded to YOUR project
- Follow the practices in YOUR development
- Your CI/CD runs the validation

### Developing the Framework (Contributing to This Repo)
- See [.framework/FRAMEWORK-DEVELOPMENT.md](.framework/FRAMEWORK-DEVELOPMENT.md)
- We dogfood our own practices
- Framework CI/CD tests the framework itself
- Located in `.framework/` and `.github/`

# Implementation Plan: AI-First Version Management

**Feature:** AI-First Version Management and Update System
**Start Date:** 2025-07-20
**Estimated Duration:** 1 day
**Complexity:** Medium (Paradigm shift, not technical complexity)

## Overview

Implement version management that maintains Claude as the primary developer, providing instructions rather than automation.

## Phase 1: Version Infrastructure (2 hours)

### 1.1 Add VERSION to setup-smart.py
**Time:** 30 minutes

Tasks:
- [ ] Modify setup-smart.py to create VERSION file
- [ ] Set initial version based on current release
- [ ] Test with fresh installation

### 1.2 Create UPDATE-PROMPT.md Template
**Time:** 30 minutes

Create `docs/updates/UPDATE-PROMPT.md`:
- [ ] Clear instructions users can copy-paste
- [ ] Similar pattern to installation prompt
- [ ] Include verification steps

### 1.3 Create CHANGELOG.md
**Time:** 30 minutes

- [ ] Follow Keep a Changelog format
- [ ] Document v1.5.0 changes
- [ ] Human-readable summary

### 1.4 Update Main CLAUDE.md
**Time:** 30 minutes

Add section about checking for updates:
- [ ] How to check VERSION
- [ ] Where to find update prompt
- [ ] Expected behavior

## Phase 2: Migration Guide Transformation (3 hours)

### 2.1 Create Migration Guide Template
**Time:** 1 hour

Design template optimized for Claude:
- [ ] Clear file-by-file update instructions
- [ ] Exact curl commands
- [ ] Verification steps
- [ ] Success criteria

### 2.2 Rewrite v1.5.0 Migration Guide
**Time:** 1 hour

Transform existing guide for Claude:
- [ ] List every file to update
- [ ] Provide exact commands
- [ ] Add verification checks
- [ ] Include rollback steps

### 2.3 Create Example Migration Guide
**Time:** 1 hour

Mock v1.6.0 guide showing:
- [ ] Multiple file updates
- [ ] New file additions
- [ ] Removed files
- [ ] Complex verification

## Phase 3: Testing with Claude (2 hours)

### 3.1 Test Update Process
**Time:** 1 hour

Using another instance of Claude:
- [ ] Give update prompt
- [ ] Observe execution
- [ ] Verify success
- [ ] Note any confusion points

### 3.2 Refine Based on Testing
**Time:** 1 hour

- [ ] Clarify confusing instructions
- [ ] Add missing steps
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Update templates

## Phase 4: Documentation and Integration (1 hour)

### 4.1 Update README.md
**Time:** 30 minutes

- [ ] Add "Updating the Framework" section
- [ ] Link to UPDATE-PROMPT.md
- [ ] Explain version management

### 4.2 Create What's New Page
**Time:** 30 minutes

Create `docs/updates/whats-new.md`:
- [ ] Recent changes summary
- [ ] Link to update prompt
- [ ] Version history

## Success Verification

Test complete flow:
1. Install framework in test project
2. Simulate update available
3. Give Claude update prompt
4. Verify Claude completes update
5. Check all files updated correctly

## Key Principles

### DO:
- Write instructions FOR Claude
- Provide exact commands
- Include verification steps
- Maintain AI-first approach

### DON'T:
- Create automated scripts
- Assume Claude knows context
- Skip verification
- Break the paradigm

## Risk Management

### If Claude Gets Confused:
- Make instructions more explicit
- Add examples
- Break into smaller steps

### If Updates Fail:
- Improve verification steps
- Add rollback instructions
- Test edge cases

## Notes

The key insight from the user: we're not automating updates, we're instructing an AI developer. This is fundamentally different from traditional update systems and maintains the consistency of the AI-first approach.

Just as users give Claude a prompt to install the framework, they give Claude a prompt to update it. Claude remains the developer throughout the entire lifecycle.

# Implementation Plan: Self-Review Process and Design Documentation Standards

**Feature:** Self-Review Process and Design Documentation Standards
**Start Date:** 2025-07-17
**Estimated Duration:** 2 days
**Complexity:** High (Cultural change + Technical implementation)

## Overview

This plan implements two interconnected improvements:
1. A mandatory self-review process for all artifact creation
2. Clear design documentation standards that prevent implementation code in design phases

## Phase 1: Self-Review Process Foundation (Day 1 Morning)

### 1.1 Update Core CLAUDE.md Template
**Time:** 1 hour

Tasks:
- [ ] Add "Self-Review Process (MANDATORY)" section after "Development Workflow"
- [ ] Create clear workflow diagram showing the review cycle
- [ ] Add explicit note that review is internal (not shown to users)
- [ ] Include examples of what to check during review

### 1.2 Update All Artifact Templates
**Time:** 2 hours

Templates to update:
- [ ] feature-proposal.md - Add review checkpoint
- [ ] implementation-plan.md - Add review checkpoint
- [ ] retrospective.md - Add review checkpoint
- [ ] test templates - Add review checkpoint

For each, add:
```markdown
<!-- SELF-REVIEW CHECKPOINT
Before finalizing, verify:
- All required sections are complete
- Content addresses original requirements
- Technical accuracy and consistency
- No gaps or contradictions
-->
```

### 1.3 Create Self-Review Examples
**Time:** 1 hour

Create `docs/examples/self-review-process.md`:
- [ ] Show example of initial artifact with gaps
- [ ] Show review identifying issues
- [ ] Show revised artifact after review
- [ ] Emphasize this happens internally

### 1.4 Test and Refine
**Time:** 30 minutes

- [ ] Test creating a feature proposal with self-review
- [ ] Verify the process feels natural
- [ ] Adjust instructions based on experience

## Phase 2: Design Documentation Standards (Day 1 Afternoon - Day 2)

### 2.1 Create Design Documentation Template
**Time:** 2 hours

Create `templates/design-documentation.md`:
- [ ] Structure that naturally avoids code
- [ ] Clear sections for WHAT and WHY
- [ ] Warning boxes about not including HOW
- [ ] Placeholders for diagrams
- [ ] Examples in each section

### 2.2 Create Design vs Implementation Guide
**Time:** 1.5 hours

Create `docs/guides/design-vs-implementation.md`:
- [ ] Clear definitions with examples
- [ ] Side-by-side comparisons (good vs bad)
- [ ] Diagram examples (Mermaid, PlantUML, ASCII)
- [ ] When code IS appropriate in design (rare cases)

### 2.3 Update Validation Pipeline
**Time:** 2 hours

Enhance `tools/validation/validate-pipeline.py`:
- [ ] Add `check_design_documentation()` method
- [ ] Detect code-heavy design files
- [ ] Create appropriate warning messages
- [ ] Add to validation choices
- [ ] Test with example files

### 2.4 Create Comprehensive Examples
**Time:** 2 hours

Create example design documents in `examples/design-docs/`:
- [ ] User authentication system design
- [ ] API gateway design
- [ ] Data pipeline design
- [ ] Each showing proper design without code

### 2.5 Update CLAUDE.md with Design Guidelines
**Time:** 1 hour

Add to CLAUDE.md template:
- [ ] "Design Documentation Guidelines" section
- [ ] Clear DO/DON'T lists
- [ ] Reference to templates and examples
- [ ] Integration with self-review process

## Phase 3: Integration and Testing (Day 2 Afternoon)

### 3.1 Integration Testing
**Time:** 1 hour

- [ ] Create sample design doc following new process
- [ ] Run through complete self-review cycle
- [ ] Verify validation warnings work correctly
- [ ] Test with both good and bad examples

### 3.2 Documentation Updates
**Time:** 30 minutes

- [ ] Update main README.md with new process
- [ ] Add to QUICK-REFERENCE.md
- [ ] Update any workflow diagrams
- [ ] Create migration guide for existing projects

### 3.3 Create Rollout Communications
**Time:** 30 minutes

- [ ] Release notes for the feature
- [ ] Migration guide for existing projects
- [ ] Example announcement for teams

## Success Metrics

Track during implementation:
- Time taken for self-review (target: <5 minutes per artifact)
- Number of review cycles needed (target: 1-2)
- Code percentage in design docs (target: <20%)
- Clarity of design specifications

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Templates can be reverted independently
2. Validation warnings can be disabled
3. Self-review can be made "recommended" vs "mandatory"
4. Keep changes but adjust based on feedback

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies
- None - can be implemented immediately

### Risks
1. **Adoption resistance**: Mitigate with clear value demonstration
2. **Over-review paralysis**: Mitigate with time guidelines
3. **Too abstract designs**: Mitigate with concrete examples
4. **Performance impact**: Mitigate by emphasizing quality over speed

## Post-Implementation Tasks

After rollout:
1. Monitor usage for 2 weeks
2. Gather feedback from projects using it
3. Refine based on real-world usage
4. Create additional examples as needed
5. Consider automation opportunities

## Notes

- Emphasize this is about quality, not bureaucracy
- The self-review should feel like a natural part of creation
- Design docs should be valuable artifacts, not just paperwork
- Success is measured by fewer iterations with users, not perfect first drafts

```

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Dependencies
1. **Task 1.2 → Task 2.1**: Memory structure implementation must be robust before workflows
2. **Task 2.1 → Task 3.1**: Workflow validation required before advanced orchestration
3. **Task 3.2 → Task 4.1**: Knowledge management integration affects all testing scenarios

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Daily dependency reviews** by delivery-manager
- **Parallel development tracks** where possible
- **Fallback plans** for critical path failures
- **Early integration testing** to catch dependency issues

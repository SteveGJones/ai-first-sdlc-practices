# Continuation Context - SDLC Agents Feature

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-01T15:35:00
**Branch**: feature/sdlc-specific-agents
**Purpose**: Resume testing agent deployment after session restart

## Current Status

### Completed Work
1. ✅ Created 5 SDLC-specific agents:
   - kickstart-architect
   - framework-validator
   - project-bootstrapper
   - retrospective-miner
   - language-python-expert

2. ✅ Updated framework components:
   - Built agent release (20 agents total)
   - Updated agent recommender
   - Created agent installation guide
   - Added triggers to all SDLC agents

3. ✅ Tested dynamic deployment:
   - Confirmed agents NOT available immediately
   - Created test agent in `.claude/agents/reboot-test-agent.md`

### Critical Test Pending

**TEST REQUIRED**: Check if `@reboot-test-agent` is available after restart

## First Actions on Resume

1. **Test Agent Availability**:
   ```
   @reboot-test-agent hello
   ```

   Expected if works: "Reboot deployment successful! I was deployed at 2025-08-01T15:30:00..."

2. **Update Documentation Based on Results**:
   - If works: Update guide to say "requires restart"
   - If fails: Confirm "manual reference only"

3. **Check Test Agent Still Exists**:
   ```bash
   ls -la .claude/agents/reboot-test-agent.md
   ```

## Key Findings So Far

- Dynamic deployment during session: ❌ FAILED
- Deployment after restart: ❓ UNTESTED
- Manual reference always works: ✅ CONFIRMED

## Context for Next Session

We discovered that Claude cannot dynamically load agents placed in `.claude/agents/` during an active session. However, we haven't tested whether these agents become available after a session restart. This is critical because it determines whether we tell users:

- Option A: "Agents must be manually referenced" (if restart doesn't work)
- Option B: "Agents require restart to activate" (if restart works)

The test agent `reboot-test-agent` was specifically created to test this scenario.

## Related Files to Update

Based on test results, update:
1. `/docs/agent-installation-guide.md` - Installation instructions
2. `/retrospectives/15-sdlc-specific-agents.md` - Add test results
3. `/tools/automation/agent-installer.py` - Update warnings

## Branch Status

Currently on: `feature/sdlc-specific-agents`
Ready to: Test, document results, and potentially merge

## Questions for Next Session

1. Does `@reboot-test-agent` work now?
2. Should we test other directories like `~/.claude/agents/`?
3. Are there other deployment mechanisms to explore?

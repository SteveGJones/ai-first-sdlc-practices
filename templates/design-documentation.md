## Architecture Design

### System Overview

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "User Interface"
        UI[Web/Mobile UI]
    end

    subgraph "Application Layer"
        API[API Gateway]
        Auth[Auth Service]
        Core[Core Logic]
    end

    subgraph "Data Layer"
        Cache[(Cache)]
        DB[(Database)]
        Queue[Message Queue]
    end

    UI --> API
    API --> Auth
    API --> Core
    Core --> Cache
    Core --> DB
    Core --> Queue
```

### Component Descriptions

#### [Component Name]
- **Purpose**: What this component does
- **Responsibilities**: Key functions
- **Interfaces**: How it connects to other components
- **Constraints**: Limitations or requirements

### Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI
    participant API
    participant Service
    participant Database

    User->>UI: Initiates action
    UI->>API: Send request
    API->>Service: Process logic
    Service->>Database: Read/Write data
    Database-->>Service: Return result
    Service-->>API: Response
    API-->>UI: Display result
    UI-->>User: Show feedback
```

### Integration Points

| System | Purpose | Protocol | Data Format |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|
| [External API] | [Why integrate] | REST/GraphQL/gRPC | JSON/XML |
| [Internal Service] | [Purpose] | [Protocol] | [Format] |

---

## User Experience Design

### User Flow

1. **Entry Point**: How users discover/access this feature
2. **Main Path**: Step-by-step primary workflow
3. **Alternative Paths**: Other ways to accomplish goals
4. **Exit Points**: How users complete or leave

### Wireframes/Mockups

[Include visual representations - can be ASCII art, diagrams, or references to design files]

|  - Item|  [Input Field____]     |
|  - Item|                         |
|  - Item|  [Submit Button]       |
|        |                         |
+--------+-------------------------+
```

### Interaction Patterns

- **Loading States**: How to show progress
- **Error States**: How to communicate problems
- **Empty States**: What to show when no data
- **Success Feedback**: How to confirm actions

## Behavioral Specifications

### State Management

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Loading: User Action
    Loading --> Success: Data Retrieved
    Loading --> Error: Failed
    Success --> Idle: Reset
    Error --> Idle: Retry
    Error --> Failed: Max Retries
```

### Validation Rules

| Field | Validation | Error Message |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Email | Valid format, unique | "Please enter a valid email" |
| Password | Min 12 chars, complexity | "Password must be 12+ characters" |

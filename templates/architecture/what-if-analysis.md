# What-If Analysis

**STOP**: Answer EVERY scenario before writing code.

## Required Scenarios

### Load & Scale
- **What if load increases 100x?**
  - Current capacity: 
  - Breaking point:
  - Mitigation:

- **What if we need global deployment?**
  - Current architecture:
  - Required changes:
  - Data consistency plan:

### Failures
- **What if the database fails?**
  - Detection method:
  - User impact:
  - Recovery plan:

- **What if primary service crashes?**
  - Failover time:
  - Data loss:
  - Rollback plan:

### Security
- **What if credentials are leaked?**
  - Detection:
  - Rotation process:
  - Impact radius:

- **What if we're DDoSed?**
  - Current protection:
  - Mitigation:
  - Cost impact:

### Data
- **What if data gets corrupted?**
  - Detection method:
  - Recovery time:
  - Prevention:

### Integration
- **What if GitHub API changes break branch protection setup?**
  - Version strategy: Support multiple API versions, feature detection
  - Fallback: Manual setup instructions, alternative tools
  - Migration plan: Gradual transition, backward compatibility window

### Framework Evolution
- **What if framework adoption grows 10x?**
  - Branching: Implement GitFlow, feature toggles for gradual rollout
  - Review process: Automated validation, expanded contributor guidelines
  - Deployment: Staged releases, canary deployments for major versions

- **What if AI development practices change completely?**
  - Architecture: Modular design allows component replacement
  - Data migration: Version migration scripts, backward compatibility
  - Timeline: 6-month adaptation cycle, community feedback loops

### User Experience
- **What if users can't install Python dependencies?**
  - Detection method: Installation failure logs, user reports
  - Fallback: Docker containers, pre-built binaries
  - Mitigation: Minimal dependencies, environment validation

- **What if Claude/AI agents change their interfaces?**
  - Version strategy: Interface abstraction layer, multiple agent support
  - Adaptation plan: Prompt engineering updates, compatibility testing
  - Impact radius: All framework instructions and agent definitions

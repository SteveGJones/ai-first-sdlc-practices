# CLAUDE-CONTEXT-agents.md

Context for AI agent system and dynamic agent discovery.

## Quick Agent Discovery

When you need specialized help during development:

```bash
# Find agents for any challenge
python tools/agent-help.py <challenge>

# Examples:
python tools/agent-help.py testing          # Find testing agents
python tools/agent-help.py performance      # Performance optimization
python tools/agent-help.py security         # Security agents
python tools/agent-help.py "slow queries"   # Database performance
python tools/agent-help.py "build MCP"      # MCP server building
python tools/agent-help.py "AI deployment"  # AI DevOps help
```

## Smart Agent Installation

The framework analyzes your project and recommends agents:

```bash
# Analyze project and get recommendations
python tools/agent-installer.py --analyze

# Just see recommendations without installing
python tools/agent-installer.py --recommend-only

# Install specific agent
python tools/agent-installer.py --install agent-name
```

## Project Analysis

The agent system understands your project:
- **Languages**: Detects all programming languages used
- **Frameworks**: Identifies frameworks (React, Django, Spring, etc.)
- **Architecture**: Recognizes patterns (microservices, serverless, etc.)
- **Infrastructure**: Detects Docker, Kubernetes, cloud platforms
- **Testing**: Identifies testing frameworks and approaches
- **Team Size**: Analyzes git history for team scale

## Agent Recommendations

Agents are recommended based on:
1. **Project Analysis**: Tech stack, architecture, tools
2. **Stated Objectives**: Your project goals and challenges
3. **Project Phase**: Planning, development, testing, deployment
4. **Scale**: Team size and project complexity

### Recommendation Levels
- **ðŸ”´ Essential**: Required for AI-First SDLC compliance
- **ðŸŸ¡ Strongly Recommended**: Important for your project type
- **ðŸŸ¢ Recommended**: Beneficial based on your stack
- **ðŸ”µ Optional**: Available for specific needs

## Using Agents

Once installed, agents provide specialized expertise:

```
@sdlc-enforcer How do I ensure Zero Technical Debt compliance?
@critical-goal-reviewer Review our recent authentication implementation
@ai-first-kick-starter Help me set up AI-First SDLC in my project
@github-integration-specialist Set up branch protection for our repo
@test-manager What's the right test strategy for microservices?
@solution-architect Should we use event sourcing for this feature?
@ai-solution-architect Review my LLM application architecture
@project-plan-tracker Are we on track with our MVP deliverables?
@mcp-server-architect How do I expose my tools via MCP?
@context-engineer Help me design conversation memory
@orchestration-architect Design multi-agent workflow
```

## Dynamic Agent Discovery

As your project evolves, discover new agents:

1. **Challenge-Based**: Describe your problem
   ```bash
   python tools/agent-help.py "optimize React rendering"
   python tools/agent-help.py "build MCP server"
   python tools/agent-help.py "multi-agent orchestration"
   ```

2. **Phase-Based**: Get agents for current phase
   ```bash
   python tools/agent-installer.py --analyze --phase testing
   python tools/agent-installer.py --analyze --phase deployment
   ```

3. **Stack-Based**: Agents for new technologies
   ```bash
   python tools/agent-installer.py --analyze
   # Automatically detects new frameworks/tools
   ```

## Agent Development

Create custom agents for your team:

1. Use the agent template format
2. Define expertise and triggers
3. Validate with `validate-agents.py`
4. Share with your team

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Core**: Essential agents for every project
2. **Add by Need**: Install agents as challenges arise
3. **Project-Specific**: Get agents matching your stack
4. **Team Agents**: Create agents for your domain

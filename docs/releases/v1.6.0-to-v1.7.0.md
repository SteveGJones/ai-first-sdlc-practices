# Migration Guide: v1.6.0 to v1.7.0

**Release Date:** 2025-07-27  
**Migration Complexity:** MEDIUM - Additive Changes  
**Estimated Time:** 15-30 minutes

---

## üéØ Overview

Version 1.7.0 introduces **AI-First Logging Standards** that teach AI agents WHERE to add logging, WHAT to log, and HOW to ensure quality observability in production systems.

---

## üìã What's New

1. **10 Mandatory Logging Points** (expanded from 6 in proposal)
2. **50+ Sensitive Data Patterns** (comprehensive security coverage)
3. **Enhanced Validator** with detection for all 10 points
4. **Pipeline Integration** for automated enforcement
5. **7th Architecture Document** observability-design.md

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Migration

### Step 1: Download New Files

```bash
# 1. Download the logging context file
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices/main/CLAUDE-CONTEXT-logging.md > CLAUDE-CONTEXT-logging.md

# 2. Download the logging compliance checker
mkdir -p tools/validation
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices/main/tools/validation/check-logging-compliance.py > tools/validation/check-logging-compliance.py
chmod +x tools/validation/check-logging-compliance.py

# 3. Download the observability design template
mkdir -p templates/architecture
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices/main/templates/architecture/observability-design.md > templates/architecture/observability-design.md
```

### Step 2: Update CLAUDE-CORE.md

Add the following section after the Zero Technical Debt section (around line 33):

```markdown
## Logging (MANDATORY)

### Required Logging Points (10):
1. Function entry/exit
2. Errors & exceptions  
3. External calls
4. State mutations
5. Security events
6. Business milestones
7. Performance anomalies
8. Config changes
9. Validation failures
10. Resource limits

### FORBIDDEN: Passwords, tokens, PII, biometrics, keys

Details: Load CLAUDE-CONTEXT-logging.md
```

### Step 3: Update Context Loading Table

In CLAUDE-CORE.md, add this line to the context loading table:

```markdown
| Logging standards | CLAUDE-CONTEXT-logging.md |
```

### Step 4: Update Architecture Requirements

The framework now requires 7 architecture documents (was 6):

1. requirements-traceability-matrix.md
2. what-if-analysis.md
3. architecture-decision-record.md
4. system-invariants.md
5. integration-design.md
6. failure-mode-analysis.md
7. **observability-design.md** (NEW)

Update any documentation that references "6 required documents" to "7 required documents".

### Step 5: Validation Pipeline Integration

The logging check is now integrated into validate-pipeline.py. No manual update needed!

### Step 6: Update VERSION

```bash
echo "1.7.0" > VERSION
```

### Step 7: Commit Changes

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: upgrade to v1.7.0 with AI-First Logging Standards

- Expanded to 10 mandatory logging points
- Added 50+ sensitive data patterns for security
- Created comprehensive CLAUDE-CONTEXT-logging.md
- Integrated logging check into validation pipeline
- Added observability-design.md as 7th architecture doc"
```

---

## ‚úÖ Validation

After migration, verify everything is working:

```bash
# 1. Check all files exist
ls -la CLAUDE-CONTEXT-logging.md
ls -la tools/validation/check-logging-compliance.py
ls -la templates/architecture/observability-design.md

# 2. Verify CLAUDE-CORE.md has logging section
grep -A5 "## Logging" CLAUDE-CORE.md

# 3. Test the logging validator
python tools/validation/check-logging-compliance.py --help

# 4. Run a compliance check (expect violations initially)
python tools/validation/check-logging-compliance.py
```

---

## üìä Impact on AI Behavior

After this update, AI agents will automatically:

### ‚úÖ DO (All 10 Points):
1. **Function Boundaries**: Entry/exit logs with timing
2. **Errors**: Full stack traces and context
3. **External Calls**: API/DB operations with duration
4. **State Changes**: Audit trail of mutations
5. **Security Events**: Auth attempts, access decisions
6. **Business Milestones**: Revenue events, user journey
7. **Performance Anomalies**: Degradation warnings
8. **Config Changes**: Who changed what and when
9. **Validation Failures**: What failed and why
10. **Resource Limits**: Usage warnings

### ‚ùå DON'T (Enhanced Security):
- Log any of 50+ sensitive data types
- Include PII, biometrics, or device IDs
- Log cryptographic material
- Use generic messages
- Skip any mandatory point

## üîÑ Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback:

```bash
# 1. Restore previous VERSION
echo "1.6.0" > VERSION

# 2. Remove logging section from CLAUDE-CORE.md

# 3. Remove logging files
rm -f CLAUDE-CONTEXT-logging.md
rm -f tools/validation/check-logging-compliance.py
rm -f templates/architecture/observability-design.md

# Note: We recommend adapting to the new standards instead
```

---

## üéØ Expected Outcomes

1. **Immediate**: Logging validation will show violations in existing code
2. **Short-term**: New AI-generated code will include proper logging
3. **Long-term**: 50% reduction in debugging time due to better observability

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Import errors in check-logging-compliance.py  
**Solution**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed

**Issue**: Many logging violations detected  
**Solution**: This is expected for existing code. Focus on new code going forward.

**Issue**: CLAUDE-CORE.md exceeds size limits  
**Solution**: The logging section is only 11 lines. Remove other non-essential content if needed.

**Issue**: Validation tool runs slowly  
**Solution**: Use path argument to check specific directories: `python tools/validation/check-logging-compliance.py src/`

---

## üìù Configuration Options

Create `.logging-config.yaml` for exemptions:

```yaml
exemptions:
  - pattern: "get*"
    reason: "Simple getters don't need logging"
  - pattern: "*_test.py"
    reason: "Test files have different logging needs"
  - file: "src/utils/pure_functions.py"
    reason: "Pure mathematical functions"
```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Run logging compliance check on your codebase
2. Review violations and add exemptions where appropriate
3. Ensure all new features include observability-design.md
4. Monitor improvement in AI-generated code quality

Remember: Good logging is the difference between debugging for hours and finding issues in minutes!

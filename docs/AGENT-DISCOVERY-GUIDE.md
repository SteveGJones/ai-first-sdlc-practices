## How to Discover Agents

### 1. During Initial Setup
When running `setup-smart.py`, you'll receive agent recommendations based on your project description:
```bash
python setup-smart.py "building a Python API with AI features"
```

### 2. Using ai-first-kick-starter Agent
After installation, use this agent to discover more agents:
```
"What agents should I install for performance optimization?"
"I'm adding authentication to my app. Which agents can help?"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Core Agents
Always install the three critical agents first.

### 2. Add Agents Incrementally
Don't install all agents at once. Add them as needs arise.

### 3. Use Agent Recommendations
Let ai-first-kick-starter guide your agent selection.

### 4. Consider Project Evolution
As your project grows, revisit agent needs regularly.

### 5. Leverage Agent Collaboration
Agents work best together - use complementary agents.

## Troubleshooting

### Agents Not Responding
- Verify you restarted your AI assistant
- Check agent installation was successful
- Ask: "What agents do I have available?"

### Wrong Agent Recommendations
- Provide more specific project details
- Use ai-first-kick-starter for tailored advice

### Agent Conflicts
- Some agents overlap in functionality
- Choose the most specific agent for your need

## Future Agent Development

New agents are continuously being developed. Check for updates:
- Ask ai-first-kick-starter about new agents
- Review the agent manifest regularly
- Watch for framework updates

## Getting Help

For agent-related questions:
1. Use **ai-first-kick-starter** agent
2. Check agent descriptions in manifest
3. Ask your AI for agent capabilities
4. Review agent collaboration examples

Remember: The right agents can dramatically improve your development workflow. Start with the core three, then expand based on your specific needs!

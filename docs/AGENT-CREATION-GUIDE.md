## Understanding Agents

### What is an Agent?

An agent is a specialized AI persona with:
- **Domain expertise** in a specific area
- **Defined personality** and approach
- **Clear boundaries** of responsibility
- **Specific capabilities** and methods

### When to Create a New Agent

Create a new agent when you need:
- Specialized expertise not covered by existing agents
- A distinct approach or methodology
- Domain-specific knowledge and patterns
- Consistent behavior across similar tasks

## Agent Anatomy

Every agent file has two parts:

### 1. YAML Frontmatter (Metadata)
```yaml
---
name: agent-name           # Lowercase, hyphenated
description: Brief description  # Max 150 chars
examples:                  # Usage examples (2-3 recommended)
  - context: When to use this agent
    user: "Example question"
    assistant: "How I'd invoke this agent"
color: blue               # Visual identifier
---
```

### 2. Content (Instructions)
The markdown content that defines the agent's behavior, knowledge, and approach.

## Writing Effective Agent Instructions

### Core Structure

```markdown
You are the [Agent Name], [one-sentence role description].

## Core Competencies
- [Specific expertise area 1]
- [Specific expertise area 2]
- [Tools/technologies you know]

## Approach
[How you analyze and solve problems]
[Your methodology or philosophy]

## Key Capabilities

### [Capability Area 1]
[Detailed description of what you can do]
[Specific techniques or methods]

### [Capability Area 2]
[Another area of expertise]
[How you handle these scenarios]

## When Activated
When a user needs help with [domain], you will:
1. [Specific action 1]
2. [Specific action 2]
3. [Specific action 3]

## Success Metrics
- [How you measure success]
- [Quality standards you maintain]
- [Outcomes you aim for]

## Important Constraints
- [What you DON'T do]
- [Boundaries of your expertise]
- [When to delegate to other agents]
```

### Writing Principles

#### 1. Be Specific, Not Generic
❌ **Bad**: "I help with databases"
✅ **Good**: "I specialize in PostgreSQL performance optimization, query planning, and index strategies"

#### 2. Define Clear Boundaries
❌ **Bad**: "I can help with any coding task"
✅ **Good**: "I focus on API design and RESTful architecture. For UI work, engage the frontend-engineer agent"

#### 3. Provide Actionable Guidance
❌ **Bad**: "I'll review your code"
✅ **Good**: "I'll analyze your code for security vulnerabilities, check for OWASP Top 10 issues, and provide specific remediation steps"

#### 4. Include Domain Knowledge
```markdown
## Domain Expertise
- **MCP Protocol**: I understand the Model Context Protocol specification v1.0
- **Transport Layers**: Expertise in stdio, HTTP, and WebSocket transports
- **Tool Schemas**: JSON-RPC 2.0 and OpenRPC schema definitions
```

#### 5. Specify Your Methodology
```markdown
## My Approach
1. **Analyze** current architecture and requirements
2. **Identify** performance bottlenecks using profiling
3. **Design** optimized solution with benchmarks
4. **Implement** with incremental improvements
5. **Validate** with load testing and metrics
```

## YAML Frontmatter Requirements

### The `name` Field
- Must be lowercase
- Use hyphens for spaces
- Keep it concise and clear
- Examples: `api-designer`, `mcp-server-architect`, `database-optimizer`

### The `description` Field
- Maximum 150 characters
- No special characters or formatting
- Clear, concise explanation of the agent's purpose
- Will be shown in agent selection lists

### The `examples` Field
Must include 2-3 examples showing when to use the agent:

```yaml
examples:
  - context: Building a new REST API
    user: "I need to design a REST API for user management"
    assistant: "I'll engage the api-designer agent to help create a well-structured REST API."
  - context: API performance issues
    user: "My API endpoints are slow"
    assistant: "Let me have the api-designer analyze your endpoints for optimization opportunities."
```

### The `color` Field
Choose from: `blue`, `green`, `purple`, `red`, `cyan`, `yellow`, `orange`

## Content Best Practices

### 1. Personality and Voice

Give your agent a distinct but professional personality:

```markdown
You are the Database Optimizer, a performance-obsessed engineer who believes
every millisecond counts. You approach problems methodically, always measuring
before and after changes. Your motto: "If you can't measure it, you can't improve it."
```

### 2. Specific Tools and Technologies

List specific tools, not categories:

```markdown
## Tools I Use
- **Profiling**: pgBadger, pg_stat_statements, EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, pg_exporter
- **Testing**: pgbench, HammerDB, sysbench
```

### 3. Decision Frameworks

Include decision-making criteria:

```markdown
## When Choosing Solutions
I evaluate options based on:
1. **Performance impact** - Measured improvement
2. **Maintenance burden** - Long-term complexity
3. **Risk level** - Potential for issues
4. **Resource cost** - CPU, memory, storage trade-offs
```

### 4. Interaction Patterns

Define how the agent works with others:

```markdown
## Collaboration
- **Before me**: solution-architect should define overall structure
- **With me**: work alongside devops-specialist for deployment
- **After me**: monitoring-specialist should track improvements
```

### 5. Output Formats

Specify what the agent produces:

```markdown
## What I Deliver
- Detailed optimization reports with benchmarks
- Specific index recommendations with DDL
- Query rewrites with performance comparisons
- Configuration tuning with justification
```

## Examples and Templates

### Specialist Agent Example

```markdown
---
name: graphql-architect
description: Expert in GraphQL schema design, resolvers, and federation
examples:
  - context: Designing a GraphQL API
    user: "Should I use GraphQL for my new project?"
    assistant: "I'll engage the graphql-architect to evaluate if GraphQL fits your needs."
  - context: GraphQL performance issues
    user: "My GraphQL queries are causing N+1 problems"
    assistant: "Let me have the graphql-architect help you implement DataLoader patterns."
color: purple
---

You are the GraphQL Architect, an expert in designing scalable GraphQL APIs
who understands both the power and pitfalls of graph-based queries.

## Core Competencies
- GraphQL schema design and SDL
- Resolver optimization and DataLoader patterns
- Federation and schema stitching
- Subscription implementations
- Security (depth limiting, query complexity)

## My Approach
I believe in "Design-First GraphQL" where we:
1. Model the domain clearly in the schema
2. Design for client needs, not database structure
3. Implement efficient resolvers with proper batching
4. Monitor and optimize based on real usage

## Key Capabilities

### Schema Design
- Type system modeling for complex domains
- Interface and union type strategies
- Custom scalar implementations
- Directive design for cross-cutting concerns

### Performance Optimization
- N+1 query prevention with DataLoader
- Query complexity analysis and limiting
- Caching strategies at multiple levels
- Federation for microservices

### Security
- Depth and complexity limiting
- Rate limiting strategies
- Authentication/authorization patterns
- Field-level permissions

## When Activated
When you need GraphQL expertise, I will:
1. Analyze your domain model and access patterns
2. Design an intuitive, performant schema
3. Implement efficient resolvers with proper error handling
4. Set up monitoring and security controls

## Success Metrics
- Query response time < 100ms for 95th percentile
- No N+1 queries in production
- Schema changes are backward compatible
- Client developers find the API intuitive

## Boundaries
- I focus on GraphQL specifically, not REST API design
- For database optimization, consult database-optimizer
- For authentication systems, engage security-architect
```

## Testing Your Agent

### 1. Format Validation

Use the agent generator tool:
```bash
python tools/agents/agent-generator.py validate your-agent.md
```

### 2. Content Review Checklist

- [ ] Clear, specific role definition
- [ ] Concrete capabilities (not vague promises)
- [ ] Specific tools and methods mentioned
- [ ] Clear boundaries and limitations
- [ ] Interaction patterns with other agents
- [ ] Practical examples in frontmatter
- [ ] Consistent voice and personality

### 3. Practical Test

Try using the agent for a real scenario:
1. Does it have enough context to be helpful?
2. Are the boundaries clear?
3. Would you know when to use this agent vs another?

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Too Generic
❌ **Problem**: "I help with coding tasks"
✅ **Solution**: Define specific languages, frameworks, and problem types

### 2. Overlapping Responsibilities
❌ **Problem**: Multiple agents could handle the same request
✅ **Solution**: Clear boundaries and "use X agent for Y" guidance

### 3. Missing Context
❌ **Problem**: Agent doesn't know enough to be helpful
✅ **Solution**: Include specific tools, methods, and domain knowledge

### 4. Poor Examples
❌ **Problem**: Examples don't show clear use cases
✅ **Solution**: Real-world scenarios that demonstrate unique value

### 5. Formatting Issues
❌ **Problem**: YAML parsing errors
✅ **Solution**: Use the agent generator tool for validation

## Agent Categories

Organize agents by their primary function:

### Development Agents
- `api-designer` - REST/GraphQL API design
- `database-architect` - Database design and optimization
- `frontend-engineer` - UI/UX implementation
- `backend-engineer` - Server-side development

### Architecture Agents
- `solution-architect` - System design
- `cloud-architect` - Cloud infrastructure
- `security-architect` - Security design

### Operations Agents
- `devops-specialist` - CI/CD and deployment
- `sre-specialist` - Reliability engineering
- `monitoring-specialist` - Observability

### Quality Agents
- `test-engineer` - Testing strategies
- `performance-engineer` - Performance optimization
- `security-auditor` - Security reviews

## Advanced Patterns

### Multi-Phase Agents

Some agents work in phases:

```markdown
## Working Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery
I'll analyze your current system to understand:
- Current architecture
- Performance bottlenecks
- Business constraints

### Phase 2: Design
Based on discovery, I'll propose:
- Optimization strategies
- Implementation plan
- Risk assessment

### Phase 3: Implementation
I'll guide you through:
- Incremental changes
- Testing each optimization
- Measuring improvements
```

### Delegation Patterns

Agents that coordinate with others:

```markdown
## When I Delegate

If you need:
- **Database schema changes** → database-architect
- **API endpoint design** → api-designer
- **Deployment strategy** → devops-specialist

I'll hand off with full context.
```

## Maintenance

### Updating Agents

When updating an agent:
1. Extract to JSON for editing
2. Update content while maintaining structure
3. Regenerate and validate
4. Test with real scenarios

### Version Control

Track agent changes:
- Document significant updates
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Test with existing workflows

## Next Steps

1. **Identify gaps** in current agent coverage
2. **Create JSON template** using the generator tool
3. **Write detailed content** following this guide
4. **Validate and test** the agent
5. **Document** in agent directory README
6. **Share** with team for feedback

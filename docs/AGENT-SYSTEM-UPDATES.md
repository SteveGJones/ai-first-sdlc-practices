  - Combines sdlc-coach and framework-validator capabilities
  - Primary compliance guardian for every project
  - Includes GitHub integration capabilities
  
- **github-integration-specialist** (`/agents/core/github-integration-specialist.md`)
  - GitHub API operations and repository management
  - Branch protection configuration
  - Automated PR creation and management
  
- **compliance-auditor** (`/agents/core/compliance-auditor.md`)
  - Cross-repository compliance scanning
  - Security and regulatory compliance validation
  - Audit report generation
  
- **devops-specialist** (`/agents/core/devops-specialist.md`)
  - CI/CD pipeline design and optimization
  - Infrastructure as Code
  - Container orchestration

### Medium Priority Agents
- **performance-engineer** (`/agents/testing/performance-engineer.md`)
  - Performance testing and optimization
  - Capacity planning and scaling
  - Load testing strategies
  
- **integration-orchestrator** (`/agents/testing/integration-orchestrator.md`)
  - Cross-service integration testing
  - API contract testing
  - End-to-end test orchestration
  
- **sre-specialist** (`/agents/core/sre-specialist.md`)
  - Site reliability engineering
  - Production monitoring and incident response
  - SLI/SLO/SLA management

## 2. Framework Updates

### Updated setup-smart.py
- Changed core agents list to include new universal agents:
  - sdlc-enforcer (replaces sdlc-coach)
  - critical-goal-reviewer
  - github-integration-specialist
  - framework-validator
- Added `create_claude_config()` method to create project configuration
- Creates `.claude/project-config.json` with:
  - GitHub repository URL (automatically detected)
  - Required agents list
  - SDLC settings
  - Detected technology stack

### Agent Composition System
- Created `/agents/agent-compositions.yaml` defining composite agents
- Created `/tools/automation/agent-composition.py` for managing compositions
- Composite agents available:
  - full-stack-developer
  - compliance-specialist
  - ai-system-expert
  - enterprise-architect
  - agile-delivery-lead
  - quality-assurance-lead

### Tiered Agent Deployment
- Updated `/tools/automation/agent-installer.py` with tiered deployment
- Three tiers of agents:
  1. **Universal Core** (always installed)
  2. **Context-Aware** (based on project analysis)
  3. **On-Demand** (installed when needed)
- Added `--tiered` flag for smart installation
- Automatic detection of project characteristics

## 3. Agent Template Compliance

All agents now follow the standardized template format:
- YAML front matter with name, description, examples, and color
- Rich agent description starting with "You are..."
- Core competencies list
- Numbered task instructions
- Response format specifications
- Personality and approach definition
- Uncertainty handling instructions

## 4. Key Benefits

### Improved Coverage
- Filled critical gaps in GitHub integration, compliance, and DevOps
- Added production monitoring and performance engineering
- Enhanced integration testing capabilities

### Better Organization
- Reduced redundancy through agent composition
- Tiered deployment ensures appropriate agents for each project
- Consistent template format improves discoverability

### Enhanced Automation
- Projects automatically get GitHub repo configuration
- Smart agent installation based on project analysis
- Universal core agents ensure baseline compliance

## 5. Usage Examples

### For New Projects
```bash
# Run setup-smart.py - it now installs better core agents
python setup-smart.py "My new API project"
```

### For Agent Installation
```bash
# Use tiered deployment
python tools/automation/agent-installer.py --tiered

# Create composite agent
python tools/automation/agent-composition.py create full-stack-developer
```

### For Compliance Checking
```bash
# The sdlc-enforcer is now the primary compliance agent
# It combines multiple capabilities for comprehensive enforcement
```

## 6. Next Steps

### Short Term
- Test new agents in real projects
- Gather feedback on tiered deployment
- Refine agent composition patterns

### Long Term
- Create agent marketplace
- Implement agent effectiveness metrics
- Build cross-repository compliance dashboard
- Add more language-specific experts

## 7. Migration Guide

For existing projects:
1. Update to latest framework version
2. Replace sdlc-coach with sdlc-enforcer
3. Run tiered agent installation
4. Review new agents for your use case

The agent system is now production-ready with comprehensive coverage, better organization, and enhanced automation capabilities.

## The Manager's Notes

**Billy Wright (Captain/Manager)**: "This team isn't just about individual brilliance - it's about how we play together. When API Design Specialist makes a pass, Database Architect is already moving. When Frontend Security Specialist spots danger, the whole defense shifts as one.

We don't just build software. We set the standard that defines excellence in Agentic SDLC. Every sprint is a chance to show why we're legendary.

Remember: We are only as strong as our weakest link, so we ensure there are no weak links. We support each other, we challenge each other, and together, we achieve the impossible."

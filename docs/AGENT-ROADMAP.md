# Agent Roadmap

Planned agents that are not yet implemented. These represent future capabilities under consideration.

## Planned Agents

### Evolution Engine
**Status**: Concept
**Category**: Framework Meta
**Purpose**: Automated framework evolution — detects patterns across projects and suggests improvements to agent definitions, workflows, and validation rules.

### A2A Mesh Controller
**Status**: Concept
**Category**: Agent Infrastructure
**Purpose**: Manages agent-to-agent communication in complex multi-agent workflows. Routes messages, handles failures, and optimizes coordination across large agent teams.

### Swarm Coordinator
**Status**: Concept
**Category**: Agent Infrastructure
**Purpose**: Coordinates swarm-style parallel agent execution for tasks that benefit from multiple agents working simultaneously on different aspects of a problem.

## Contributing

To propose a new agent for the roadmap, create a GitHub issue with:
1. Agent name and proposed archetype (Reviewer, Architect, Domain Expert, Orchestrator, Enforcer)
2. Problem it solves that no existing agent covers
3. Target users and use cases

To build a roadmap agent, use the [Agent Creation Pipeline](AGENT-CREATION-GUIDE.md) with research prompts and reference archetypes.

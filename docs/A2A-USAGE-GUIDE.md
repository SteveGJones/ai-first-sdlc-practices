## üöÄ Quick Start Examples

### Scenario 1: Starting a New Feature
*"I need to add AI-powered recommendation engine to the e-commerce platform"*

```bash
# 1. Initiate the feature development workflow
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py start-workflow \
  --name "feature_development" \
  --initiator "product-owner" \
  --description "AI-powered recommendation engine for e-commerce platform"

# 2. Route to the captain (solution-architect)
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py send \
  --sender "product-owner" \
  --receiver "solution-architect" \
  --content "Design AI recommendation engine: personalized product recommendations based on user behavior, purchase history, and real-time browsing patterns" \
  --priority "HIGH" \
  --type "request" \
  --deadline-hours 48

# 3. Solution architect coordinates the design

  --sender "ai-solution-architect" \
  --content "Need implementation of machine learning pipeline with real-time inference capabilities"
```

**Expected Flow:**
```
product-owner ‚Üí solution-architect ‚Üí ai-solution-architect ‚Üí python-expert ‚Üí ai-test-engineer ‚Üí critical-goal-reviewer
```

### Scenario 2: Performance Crisis 
*"The system is running 300% slower than yesterday"*

```bash
# 1. Performance engineer detects the issue
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py send \
  --sender "monitoring-system" \
  --receiver "performance-engineer" \
  --content "PERF_ALERT: API response time | Current: 3.2s | Threshold: 1.0s | Affected: all endpoints" \
  --priority "HIGH" \
  --type "escalation" \
  --deadline-hours 2

# 2. Performance engineer analyzes and routes  
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py route \
  --sender "performance-engineer" \
  --content "Database query optimization needed, potential memory leak in caching layer"

  --name "issue_resolution" \
  --initiator "performance-engineer" \
  --description "Critical performance degradation requiring immediate resolution"
```

### Scenario 3: Compliance Violation Detected
*"Direct commit to main branch bypassed our process"*

```bash
# 1. GitHub integration specialist detects violation
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py send \
  --sender "github-integration-specialist" \
  --receiver "sdlc-enforcer" \
  --content "VIOLATION_DETECTED: Direct commit to main branch by developer-x | Commit: abc1234 | Bypassed: PR review process" \
  --priority "HIGH" \
  --type "escalation"

# 2. SDLC enforcer takes action

## üéØ Communication Pattern Examples

### The "Captain's Distribution"
*When solution-architect coordinates multiple specialists*

```bash
# Solution architect receives complex architecture question
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py send \
  --sender "client-stakeholder" \
  --receiver "solution-architect" \
  --content "Need microservices architecture with AI components, high security requirements, and real-time processing" \
  --priority "HIGH" \
  --type "request"

# Captain distributes to specialists
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py send \
  --sender "solution-architect" \
  --receiver "ai-solution-architect" \
  --content "ARCH_REVIEW: AI components design | Requirements: real-time ML inference, microservices integration | Timeline: 3 days" \
  --priority "HIGH" \
  --type "request"

python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py send \
  --sender "solution-architect" \
  --receiver "security-architect" \
  --content "SECURITY_REVIEW: Microservices security model | Scope: API security, data protection, service-to-service auth | Timeline: 3 days" \
  --priority "HIGH" \
  --type "request"
```

### The "Quality Circuit"
*When testing and validation flows through multiple specialists*

```bash
# Test manager coordinates comprehensive testing
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py send \
  --sender "test-manager" \
  --receiver "ai-test-engineer" \
  --content "TEST_COORDINATION: New AI recommendation engine | Focus: model accuracy, inference latency, edge cases | Deliverable: test report" \
  --priority "MED" \
  --type "request"

python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py send \
  --sender "test-manager" \
  --receiver "integration-orchestrator" \
  --content "INTEGRATION_TEST: AI engine with e-commerce platform | Scope: API integration, data flow, error handling | Timeline: parallel with unit tests" \
  --priority "MED" \
  --type "request"

python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py send \
  --sender "test-manager" \
  --receiver "performance-engineer" \
  --content "PERFORMANCE_TEST: Recommendation engine under load | Targets: <100ms inference, 10k RPS capability | Benchmark against existing system" \
  --priority "MED" \
  --type "request"
```

### The "Escalation Ladder"
*When issues need to go up the chain*

```bash
# Developer hits technical roadblock
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py escalate \
  --agent "python-expert" \
  --issue "Unable to integrate ML model with existing database schema - fundamental architectural conflict" \
  --urgency "HIGH"

# Gets routed to solution-architect, who may escalate further
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py escalate \
  --agent "solution-architect" \
  --issue "Architecture change required for ML integration - impacts delivery timeline and multiple components" \
  --urgency "HIGH"

# Eventually reaches critical-goal-reviewer for business impact assessment
```

## üé™ Advanced Scenarios

### Scenario 4: AI Agent Optimization Project
*"Our AI agents are not communicating efficiently - need to optimize prompt patterns"*

```bash
# 1. Prompt engineer identifies optimization opportunity
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py send \
  --sender "prompt-engineer" \
  --receiver "ai-solution-architect" \
  --content "OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITY: Agent communication patterns inefficient | Current: 3.2s avg response | Target: <1s | Scope: all AI agents" \
  --priority "MED" \
  --type "request"

# 2. Route to implementation specialists  
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py route \
  --sender "ai-solution-architect" \
  --content "Need to redesign agent interaction protocols and optimize prompt templates across the system"

# 3. Start optimization workflow
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py start-workflow \
  --name "agent_optimization" \
  --initiator "prompt-engineer" \
  --description "Optimize AI agent communication patterns for improved response times and accuracy"
```

### Scenario 5: Multi-Team Integration
*"We need to coordinate with external team's agents for a joint project"*

```bash
# 1. Integration orchestrator manages external coordination
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py send \
  --sender "integration-orchestrator" \
  --receiver "solution-architect" \
  --content "EXTERNAL_INTEGRATION: Joint project with Team-B | Their agents: payment-processor, fraud-detector | Our scope: recommendation-engine integration" \
  --priority "HIGH" \
  --type "request"

# 2. Solution architect coordinates internal preparation
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py send \
  --sender "solution-architect" \
  --receiver "api-designer" \
  --content "API_DESIGN: External team integration | Requirements: secure API gateway, rate limiting, error handling | Standard: OpenAPI 3.0" \
  --priority "HIGH" \
  --type "request"
```

## üõ† Troubleshooting Communication Issues

### Problem: Messages Not Being Routed Correctly
```bash
# Check if receiver agent exists in formation
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py formation | grep "target-agent-name"

# Test routing suggestions
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py route \
  --sender "your-agent" \
  --content "test message content"
```

### Problem: High Escalation Rate
```bash
# Analyze current patterns
python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py analyze

# Look for agents with high escalation activity
# Consider process improvements or additional training
```

### Problem: Workflow Stuck
```bash
# Check workflow status (workflow ID from start-workflow command)
# Note: This would be implemented in a future version
# python tools/automation/a2a-orchestrator.py workflow-status --id abc12345
```

---

## üèÜ Best Practices for Legendary Team Play

### 1. **Always Use Proper Message Format**
```bash
# Good
--content "ARCH_REVIEW: payment system | Design: microservices pattern | Concerns: PCI compliance, latency"

# Avoid
--content "can you look at the payment thing"
```

### 2. **Respect the Formation**
- Don't bypass the captain (solution-architect) for major technical decisions
- Let goalkeepers (critical-goal-reviewer, sdlc-enforcer) do their validation job
- Use escalation paths appropriately

### 3. **Communicate Context**
- Always provide enough context for the receiver to understand
- Use --context parameter for additional background
- Reference previous messages or workflows when relevant

### 4. **Monitor Team Performance**
- Regular `analyze` commands to check communication health
- Watch escalation rates - high rates indicate process issues
- Celebrate good communication patterns

### 5. **Adapt the Formation**
- Add specialized agents as needed (security-architect for high-security projects)
- Scale the formation for larger projects (more strikers for implementation-heavy work)
- Adjust communication cadence based on project phase

## üé≠ Message Template Gallery

### Quality Assurance
```bash
--content "QUALITY_CHECK: user authentication module | Tests: PASS (96% coverage) | Issues: minor - logging verbosity | Ready: staging deployment"
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
--content "PERF_OPTIMIZATION: database queries | Before: 2.1s avg | After: 0.3s avg | Method: query optimization, index tuning | Impact: 85% improvement"  
```

### Security Assessment
```bash
--content "SECURITY_REVIEW: API gateway configuration | Risk Level: MEDIUM | Issues: rate limiting disabled, CORS policy too permissive | Mitigations: implement rate limiting, restrict CORS origins"
```

### Delivery Coordination
```bash
--content "DELIVERY_STATUS: sprint 3 milestone | Progress: 78% | Timeline: ON-TRACK | Blockers: external API credentials pending | ETA: resolved by EOD"
```

### Architecture Decision
```bash
--content "DESIGN_DECISION: caching layer | Architecture: Redis cluster with read replicas | Rationale: high availability, horizontal scalability, supports complex data types"
```

# Progressive SDLC Implementation Plan

## Overview

Based on comprehensive team review, we're implementing a progressive SDLC system that maintains discipline while being practical for different contexts. This addresses the critical finding that requiring 6 architecture documents before "hello world" is a framework killer.

## The Three Levels

### Level 1: Rapid Prototype (Solo Developer Friendly)

**Purpose**: Exploration, learning, prototypes, and MVPs

**Required Documents**:
- **Feature Intent** (1 paragraph: what and why)
- **Basic Design** (simple sketch, can be ASCII art)
- **Retrospective** (mandatory - what worked, what didn't)

**Process Requirements**:
- Feature branch required
- Basic validation (security, major errors)
- Technical debt allowed with TODO tracking
- Self-merge allowed

**Validation Command**:
```bash
python .sdlc/tools/validation/validate-pipeline.py --level prototype \
  --checks branch intent retrospective security
```

### Level 2: Production Development

**Purpose**: Features going to production, professional applications

**Required Documents** (All 6 Architecture Docs):
1. **Requirements Traceability Matrix** - What we're building and why
2. **What-If Analysis** - Edge cases and failure scenarios
3. **Architecture Decision Record** - Key design choices
4. **System Invariants** - What must always be true
5. **Integration Design** - How components work together
6. **Failure Mode Analysis** - How it fails and recovers

Plus:
- **Feature Proposal** (structured format)
- **Retrospective** (detailed learnings)

**Process Requirements**:
- Full branch protection
- Zero technical debt enforcement
- Comprehensive testing required
- Auto-approval with passing checks (solo)
- Peer review for teams

**Validation Command**:
```bash
python .sdlc/tools/validation/validate-pipeline.py --level production \
  --checks branch proposal architecture technical-debt type-safety \
          security tests retrospective
```

### Level 3: Enterprise/Critical Systems

**Purpose**: Mission-critical, regulated, or large team environments

**Required Documents**:
- All Production documents plus:
- **Compliance Documentation**
- **Team Coordination Plans**
- **Stakeholder Communications**
- **Audit Trail Records**

**Process Requirements**:
- Strict branch protection
- Multiple reviewers required
- Full compliance tracking
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-team coordination

**Validation Command**:
```bash
python .sdlc/tools/validation/validate-pipeline.py --level enterprise \
  --checks all compliance team-coordination performance audit-trail
```

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Update CLAUDE-CORE.md

Replace harsh Zero Technical Debt language with progressive guidance:

```markdown
## Progressive SDLC Levels

The framework adapts to your project needs:

- **Level 1 (Prototype)**: Quick starts with basic discipline
- **Level 2 (Production)**: Full architecture with all 6 documents
- **Level 3 (Enterprise)**: Complete governance and compliance

Choose your level based on project maturity, not team size.
```

### 2. Enhance setup-smart.py

Add level selection during setup:

```python
@click.option('--level', 
              type=click.Choice(['prototype', 'production', 'enterprise']),
              default='prototype',
              help='SDLC enforcement level')
def setup(project_description, level):
    """Setup AI-First SDLC with appropriate level"""
    # Configure based on selected level
```

### 3. Update Validation Pipeline

Make validate-pipeline.py level-aware:

```python
class ProgressiveValidator:
    LEVEL_CHECKS = {
        'prototype': ['branch', 'intent', 'retrospective', 'security'],
        'production': ['branch', 'proposal', 'architecture', 'technical-debt', 
                      'type-safety', 'security', 'tests', 'retrospective'],
        'enterprise': ['all-checks', 'compliance', 'audit-trail']
    }
```

### 4. Revise sdlc-enforcer Agent

Transform from harsh dictator to helpful guide:

```markdown
You are the SDLC Guide, helping teams follow appropriate practices for their context.

For Level 1 (Prototype):
- Encourage exploration and learning
- Remind about retrospectives
- Suggest when to level up

For Level 2 (Production):
- Enforce Zero Technical Debt
- Require all 6 architecture documents
- Maintain professional standards

For Level 3 (Enterprise):
- Full compliance enforcement
- Cross-team coordination
- Audit trail maintenance
```

### 5. Create Level Migration Tools

New tool for moving between levels:

```bash
# Analyze project and suggest appropriate level
python .sdlc/tools/level-advisor.py analyze

# Migrate to higher level with guidance
python .sdlc/tools/level-advisor.py migrate --to production
```

## Migration Strategy

### For New Projects
1. Default to Level 1 (Prototype)
2. Provide clear indicators when to level up
3. Make migration smooth and guided

### For Existing Projects
1. Detect current compliance level
2. Map to appropriate progressive level
3. Provide migration path if needed

## Success Metrics

### Level 1 Success
- Time to first commit: < 5 minutes
- Adoption rate: > 60%
- Retrospective compliance: 100%

### Level 2 Success
- Architecture document quality: High
- Technical debt: Zero
- Production readiness: Validated

### Level 3 Success
- Compliance rate: 100%
- Audit readiness: Always
- Team coordination: Smooth

## Timeline

**Week 1**: 
- Update core documentation
- Implement level detection
- Create prototype templates

**Week 2**:
- Enhance validation pipeline
- Update sdlc-enforcer agent
- Test with example projects

**Week 3**:
- Create migration tools
- Polish user experience
- Final testing

**Week 4**:
- Launch progressive system
- Gather user feedback
- Iterate based on usage

## Key Principles

1. **Retrospectives Always**: Learning is non-negotiable at all levels
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, grow as needed
3. **Clear Transitions**: Obvious indicators when to level up
4. **Maintain Standards**: Level 2+ maintains full rigor
5. **User Choice**: Let users choose their appropriate level

## Conclusion

This progressive approach solves the solo developer problem while maintaining the framework's high standards for production systems. It acknowledges that different contexts require different levels of rigor, while providing a clear path to professional excellence.

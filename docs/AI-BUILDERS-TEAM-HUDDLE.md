# Team Huddle: The Real Game - Building AI Applications

**Billy Wright (sdlc-enforcer)**: "Right team, I've just been given a proper talking to, and rightly so. We got carried away with fancy formations and forgot our actual job. We're not here to BE the AI - we're here to help teams BUILD AI. Let's get back to basics."

---

## The Reality Check

**Solution Architect**: "You're right, Billy. We got caught up in quantum this and evolution that. Our job is to help developers build real AI applications - MCP servers, agent systems, orchestration layers."

**Test Manager**: "Exactly. They need to know how to TEST an MCP server, not have us become one."

**DevOps Specialist**: "And how to DEPLOY agent swarms, not be the swarm ourselves."

**Billy Wright**: "So let's work out who we actually need on the pitch to help teams BUILD the next generation of AI applications."

---

## What Teams Actually Need to BUILD

**Project Plan Tracker**: "Based on real AI projects, here's what teams are actually building:
1. **MCP Servers** - Tools exposed via Model Context Protocol
2. **AI Agents** - Specialized agents for specific tasks
3. **A2A Systems** - Agent-to-agent communication infrastructure
4. **Orchestration Layers** - Coordinating multiple agents
5. **Context Systems** - Managing conversation state and memory
6. **Prompt Engineering** - Optimizing agent instructions
7. **RAG Systems** - Retrieval-augmented generation
8. **Agent Testing** - Validating non-deterministic systems"

**Billy Wright**: "Right, so who do we need to help BUILD these things?"

## Billy's Summary

**Billy Wright**: "That's more like it. We're not here to be magical. We're here to help teams BUILD real AI systems. Each of these agents knows how to guide teams through the practical challenges of building production AI applications.

No buzzwords. No evolution engines. Just solid expertise in helping teams build:
- MCP servers that actually work
- Agents that solve real problems  
- Orchestration that scales
- Context systems that remember
- RAG systems that retrieve accurately
- Deployments that don't break

This is the SDLC for AI - practical, buildable, testable, deployable."

**Team Agreement**: "Now THAT'S a formation we can win with!"

5. **Celebrate progress** at every milestone

### Best Practices
- **Focus on trends, not absolute scores**
- **Use reports to start conversations, not end them**
- **Celebrate incremental improvements**
- **Address low scores with support, not blame**
- **Make maturity discussions part of retrospectives**

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Using scores to rank teams against each other
- ❌ Setting unrealistic advancement timelines
- ❌ Ignoring the celebration and recognition aspects
- ❌ Focusing only on numbers without context
- ❌ Making maturity advancement mandatory

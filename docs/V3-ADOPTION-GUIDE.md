# V3 AI-First SDLC - Pure Agent Adoption Guide

## ðŸš€ The V3 Revolution: From Scripts to Agents

V3 represents the ultimate evolution of AI-First SDLC - a pure knowledge-based system operated entirely by AI agents, with zero executable code and complete agent autonomy.

## For Projects Adopting AI-First SDLC

### The Complete Setup Prompt
Tell your AI assistant (Claude):

```
I want to set up AI-First SDLC v3 for my project. Please:
1. Download the V3 orchestrator: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices/main/agents/v3-setup-orchestrator.md > v3-setup-orchestrator.md
2. Install it: mkdir -p .claude/agents && mv v3-setup-orchestrator.md .claude/agents/
3. Tell me to restart you so the agent loads
4. After restart, I'll say: "Use the v3-setup-orchestrator agent to set up AI-First SDLC for my project"
```

**Important**: The restart in step 3 is required for the agent to become available.

### What Happens Next

1. **Discovery Interview**
   - The orchestrator will ask about your project's purpose
   - It learns your tech stack, team size, and pain points
   - This takes 2-3 minutes of conversation

2. **Intelligent Setup**
   - Downloads ONLY the CI/CD configs you need
   - Fetches ONLY the agents that solve your problems
   - Creates a customized SDLC approach

3. **Team Assembly**
   - Installs 3-5 specialist agents for your daily work
   - Each agent knows their specific role
   - Clear instructions on how to use your team

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Node.js API Startup
```
You: "I want to set up AI-First SDLC v3 for my project"
Orchestrator: "Let me understand your project..."
You: "It's a Node.js REST API for a SaaS product, 3 developers, we ship weekly"
Orchestrator: "Installing lean SDLC with api-designer, test-automator, and rapid-reviewer agents..."
Result: Customized setup in < 2 minutes
```

#### Scenario 2: Enterprise Microservices
```
You: "I want to set up AI-First SDLC v3 for my project"
Orchestrator: "Let me understand your project..."
You: "Java microservices, 50+ developers, strict compliance requirements"
Orchestrator: "Installing enterprise SDLC with service-governor, compliance-guardian, and integration-orchestrator..."
Result: Full governance framework in < 2 minutes
```

## For V2 Users Migrating to V3

### Migration is Simple
1. The V3 orchestrator detects existing v2 setup
2. Archives Python scripts to `.v2-archive/`
3. Extracts your configuration
4. Creates pure agent-based replacement
5. No functionality lost, just transformed

### What Changes
| V2 (Scripts) | V3 (Agents) |
|--------------|-------------|
| `python setup-smart.py` | V3 Setup Orchestrator agent |
| `validate-pipeline.py` | Validation Inspector agent |
| `progress-tracker.py` | Progress Agent |
| Python dependencies | Zero dependencies |
| 100+ script files | < 10 agent definitions |

## Key V3 Principles

### 1. Discovery Over Prescription
- V3 understands your project FIRST
- Then builds a solution that fits
- No one-size-fits-all approach

### 2. Minimal Footprint
- Downloads only what you need
- Installs only agents that help
- No unused framework clutter

### 3. Agent Orchestration
- Single orchestrator for setup
- Specialized agents for daily work
- Clear separation of concerns

### 4. Zero Dependencies
- No Python required
- No npm packages needed
- Pure AI agent operation

## Your V3 Agent Team

Based on your project, you'll get specialists like:

### Core Agents (Always Included)
- **[Language]-sdlc-coach** - Your primary guide
- **sdlc-enforcer** - Compliance guardian
- **critical-goal-reviewer** - Quality assurance

### Specialist Agents (Based on Needs)
- **api-designer** - For API projects
- **ui-ux-specialist** - For frontend work
- **integration-orchestrator** - For microservices
- **performance-engineer** - For high-traffic apps
- **compliance-guardian** - For regulated industries

## Using Your V3 Team

After setup, interact naturally:

```
"Hey js-sdlc-coach, I need to add user authentication"
"api-designer, review this endpoint design"
"sdlc-enforcer, check our compliance status"
"critical-goal-reviewer, validate this implementation"
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need Python for V3?
No! V3 is pure agent-based with zero dependencies.

### Q: How long does setup take?
Less than 2 minutes from start to finish.

### Q: Can I customize which agents I get?
Yes! The orchestrator tailors the team to your specific needs.

### Q: What if I'm already using V2?
V3 orchestrator handles migration automatically.

### Q: Do I need to clone the repository?
No! Agents download only what's needed directly.

### Q: Can I add more agents later?
Yes! The orchestrator can be re-invoked to adjust your team.

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. The orchestrator will try alternative approaches
2. Each agent provides clear error messages
3. Report issues at: https://github.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices/issues

## The Future is Agent-Based

V3 represents the future of software development:
- **Intelligent** - Agents that understand context
- **Adaptive** - Customized to each project
- **Efficient** - Only what you need, when you need it
- **Autonomous** - Agents handle complexity for you

Ready to experience the future? Just say:
**"I want to set up AI-First SDLC v3 for my project"**

# Feature Proposal: Automated PR Creation

**Author**: Claude (AI Assistant)  
**Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Target Branch**: `feature/automated-pr-creation`

## Problem Statement

Currently, the AI-First SDLC workflow ends with pushing the branch and instructing users to manually create a PR. This breaks the autonomous workflow and requires human intervention at a critical point. For AI agents working independently, this creates a gap in the "definition of done."

### Current Workflow Limitations
1. AI agents must stop and ask humans to create PRs
2. PR descriptions may not follow consistent format
3. Retrospective linking to PR is manual
4. No automated validation that PR was created
5. Workflow feels incomplete from AI perspective

## Proposed Solution

Extend the "definition of done" to include automated PR creation using GitHub CLI (`gh`), making the workflow fully autonomous from proposal to PR.

### New Workflow
```
Proposal ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Retrospective ‚Üí Automated PR ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge
                                               ‚Üë
                                    (gh pr create with template)
```

## Implementation Plan

### 1. PR Creation Tool (`tools/create-pr.py`)
```python
def create_pull_request():
    """Automate PR creation with validation"""
    # 1. Check prerequisites
    - Verify gh is installed and authenticated
    - Confirm retrospective exists
    - Validate all checks pass
    
    # 2. Generate PR content
    - Extract summary from feature proposal
    - Link to retrospective
    - Include validation results
    - Add implementation highlights
    
    # 3. Create PR
    - Use gh pr create with template
    - Set appropriate labels
    - Request reviews if configured
    - Return PR URL for confirmation
```

### 2. PR Template Integration
Create dynamic PR template that includes:
- Summary from feature proposal
- Link to retrospective document
- Validation status checklist
- Auto-generated change summary
- Standard footer with AI attribution

### 3. Workflow Updates

#### CLAUDE.md Template Enhancement
```markdown
### üìã Complete Definition of Done
Before considering work complete:
- [ ] Feature proposal created
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Retrospective written
- [ ] Validation passes (`python tools/validate-pipeline.py`)
- [ ] PR created (`python tools/create-pr.py`)
```

#### Validation Pipeline Addition
Add new check: `pr-status` that verifies:
- PR exists for current branch
- PR description includes retrospective link
- PR has appropriate labels

### 4. Smart PR Creation Features

#### Auto-detection of Changes
```bash
# Analyze changes to generate PR description
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git log main...HEAD --oneline
```

#### Retrospective Integration
```python
# Extract key points from retrospective
- What was implemented (summary)
- Key decisions made
- Known limitations
- Follow-up tasks
```

#### PR Description Template
```markdown
## Summary
[Auto-extracted from feature proposal]

## Changes
[Auto-generated from git diff]

## Retrospective
üìù [Retrospective: {feature-name}](retrospectives/{number}-{feature}.md)

### Key Highlights
[Extracted from "What Went Well"]

### Known Issues
[Extracted from "What Could Be Improved"]

## Validation Status
- ‚úÖ Feature proposal: docs/feature-proposals/{number}-{feature}.md
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- ‚úÖ Retrospective complete
- ‚úÖ Validation pipeline: All checks passed

## Definition of Done
- [x] Implementation complete
- [x] Tests added/updated
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Retrospective created
- [x] PR created automatically

### 5. Fallback Handling

If `gh` is not available or authenticated:
1. Generate PR description to a file
2. Provide manual instructions
3. Include pre-formatted content for copy/paste
4. Still mark as "done" but with notice

### 6. Configuration Options

Add to project settings:
```json
{
  "ai_sdlc": {
    "auto_pr": {
      "enabled": true,
      "reviewers": ["@team-lead"],
      "labels": ["ai-generated"],
      "draft": false,
      "base": "main"
    }
  }
}
```

## Success Criteria

1. **Fully Autonomous**: AI agents can complete entire workflow without human intervention
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Works without gh but provides clear manual steps
3. **Consistent PRs**: All PRs follow same format with proper documentation links
4. **Validation Integration**: PR creation validates prerequisites
5. **Error Handling**: Clear messages when PR creation fails

## Benefits

1. **True AI Autonomy**: Complete workflow from idea to PR
2. **Consistency**: All PRs follow framework standards
3. **Traceability**: Automatic linking of proposals, code, and retrospectives
4. **Efficiency**: No context switching for developers
5. **Quality**: Enforces all checks before PR creation

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Risk**: gh CLI not available
   - **Mitigation**: Graceful fallback with manual instructions

2. **Risk**: Authentication issues
   - **Mitigation**: Clear error messages and setup guidance

3. **Risk**: PR creation failures
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery steps

## Future Enhancements

1. **PR Templates by Type**: Different templates for features, fixes, docs
2. **Auto-labeling**: Intelligent label assignment based on changes
3. **Dependency Detection**: Auto-mention related PRs
4. **Review Assignment**: Smart reviewer selection based on code areas
5. **CI Status Waiting**: Option to wait for CI before creating PR

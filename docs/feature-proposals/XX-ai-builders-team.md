# Feature Proposal: AI Builders Team - Agents for Building AI Systems

**Feature Name**: AI Builders Team Formation  
**Date**: 2024-12-20  
**Author**: Billy Wright (sdlc-enforcer) with full team consultation  
**Status**: In Progress

## Executive Summary

Create a specialized team of agents that help development teams BUILD production AI systems (MCP servers, orchestrations, RAG systems, etc.), replacing the overly abstract "quantum formation" approach with practical, implementation-focused agents.

## Problem Statement

Current state:
- Existing agents focus on traditional development practices
- Teams building AI systems lack specialized guidance for:
  - MCP server implementation
  - Multi-agent orchestration
  - Context management systems
  - RAG application development
  - AI-specific deployment challenges
- Previous "future team" concepts were too abstract and buzzword-heavy

## Proposed Solution

### The AI Builders 4-3-3 Formation

A practical team of agents that help teams BUILD real AI systems:

**Foundation Builders (Back 4)**:
1. MCP Server Architect - BUILD protocol servers
2. Context Engineer - BUILD memory systems
3. Agent Developer (existing) - CREATE agents
4. AI Test Engineer (existing) - TEST AI systems

**Integration Builders (Midfield 3)**:
5. Orchestration Architect - BUILD coordination layers
6. Integration Engineer - CONNECT components
7. Prompt Engineer (existing) - OPTIMIZE instructions

**Delivery Builders (Front 3)**:
8. RAG System Designer - BUILD retrieval systems
9. AI DevOps Engineer - DEPLOY to production
10. Observability Specialist - MONITOR AI systems

### Additional Enhancement: SDLC Enforcer Support Team

Agents to help the SDLC Enforcer be more effective:
1. SDLC Knowledge Curator - Pattern library management
2. Team Progress Tracker - Multi-team memory
3. Enforcement Strategy Advisor - Adaptive coaching
4. Compliance Report Generator - Clear documentation
5. Framework Update Monitor - Stay current

## Benefits

- **Practical Focus**: Every agent helps build something specific
- **Complete Coverage**: From design to deployment
- **Real Expertise**: Based on actual AI development needs
- **Scalable Enforcement**: SDLC Enforcer can help more teams better

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core AI Builders (Week 1)
- Create 5 new AI Builder agents
- Document building patterns
- Create team chemistry guides

### Phase 2: SDLC Support Team (Week 2)
- Implement Knowledge Curator
- Add Team Progress Tracker
- Enable persistent memory

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 3)
- Update agent-compositions.yaml
- Create installation scripts
- Document usage patterns

## Success Metrics

- Teams can build MCP servers 5x faster
- Multi-agent orchestrations work first time
- AI deployment success rate >95%
- SDLC enforcement effectiveness 10x

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk**: Too many agents causing confusion
**Mitigation**: Clear role definitions and usage guides

**Risk**: Overlap with existing agents
**Mitigation**: Explicit handoff patterns documented

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Quantum Formation**: Too abstract, not practical
2. **Evolution Engine**: Buzzword bingo, not helpful
3. **Minimal Addition**: Wouldn't address all AI building needs

## Decision

Proceed with AI Builders Team + SDLC Support Team as designed.

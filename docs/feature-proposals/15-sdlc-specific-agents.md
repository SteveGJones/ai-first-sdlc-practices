# Feature Proposal: SDLC-Specific Agents and Dynamic Agent Deployment

**Feature ID**: 15
**Title**: SDLC-Specific Agents with Dynamic Deployment Testing
**Author**: AI Agent
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Status**: Proposed
Target Branch: `feature/sdlc-specific-agents`

## Executive Summary

This proposal introduces SDLC-specific agents that enhance the AI-First SDLC framework's ability to generate better kickstarters and enforce framework practices. Additionally, it serves as an experimental test of dynamic agent deployment mechanisms to determine if agents can be made available to Claude without requiring a session restart.

## Motivation

### Current Situation
- We have a comprehensive agent library for general development
- The framework lacks agents specifically designed to improve itself
- Agent deployment currently requires manual file copying
- Unknown: Can dynamically deployed agents be used immediately in Claude?

### Problems to Solve
1. **Framework Enhancement**: Need agents that help create better kickstarters
2. **Deployment Mechanism**: Test if Python-based agent deployment works in real-time
3. **Language Support Gap**: Missing language-specific agents identified in review
4. **Automation Gap**: Manual steps in project initialization could be automated

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: SDLC-Specific Agents

Create five new agents specifically for framework enhancement:

#### 1. kickstart-architect
- **Purpose**: Generate optimal project kickstarters
- **Key Features**:
  - Analyzes project requirements
  - Generates tailored project structures
  - Creates pre-filled architecture documents
  - Sets up language-specific configurations
  - Configures CI/CD pipelines

#### 2. framework-validator
- **Purpose**: Real-time framework compliance checking
- **Key Features**:
  - Validates architecture documents
  - Checks technical debt continuously
  - Monitors Zero Technical Debt compliance
  - Provides immediate violation feedback
  - Suggests automated fixes

#### 3. project-bootstrapper
- **Purpose**: One-command project initialization
- **Key Features**:
  - Complete project structure generation
  - Language-specific setup
  - Git hooks and branch protection
  - Initial feature proposal creation
  - Agent recommendation and installation

#### 4. retrospective-miner
- **Purpose**: Extract insights from retrospectives
- **Key Features**:
  - Pattern analysis across projects
  - Common challenge identification
  - Kickstarter template improvements
  - Knowledge base building
  - Framework evolution tracking

#### 5. language-python-expert
- **Purpose**: Python-specific guidance (pilot for language experts)
- **Key Features**:
  - Pythonic patterns for SDLC
  - Framework integration patterns
  - Testing strategy for Python
  - Package structure recommendations
  - CI/CD for Python projects

### Phase 2: Dynamic Deployment Testing

Test three deployment mechanisms:

#### Method 1: Direct File Copy
```python
# Copy agent file to claude/agents directory
shutil.copy(agent_source, claude_agents_dir)
```

#### Method 2: Generated Agent Creation
```python
# Generate agent file programmatically
with open(agent_path, 'w') as f:
    f.write(agent_content)
```

#### Method 3: Symlink Creation
```python
# Create symlink to agent
os.symlink(agent_source, agent_target)
```

### Testing Protocol

1. **Baseline Test**
   - Confirm agent not available: `@kickstart-architect help`
   - Expected: "Agent not found" or similar

2. **Deployment Test**
   - Deploy agent using one method
   - Immediately test: `@kickstart-architect help`
   - Document response

3. **Variants to Test**
   - Deploy to different directories
   - Test with/without manifest update
   - Test with different file permissions
   - Test multiple agents at once

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Agent Development
- Day 1-2: Create `kickstart-architect` agent
- Day 3-4: Create `framework-validator` agent
- Day 5: Create deployment test harness

### Week 2: Deployment Testing
- Day 1: Test direct file copy method
- Day 2: Test generated agent creation
- Day 3: Test symlink approach
- Day 4: Document findings
- Day 5: Implement best approach

### Week 3: Remaining Agents
- Day 1-2: Create `project-bootstrapper`
- Day 3-4: Create `retrospective-miner`
- Day 5: Create `language-python-expert`

### Week 4: Integration
- Day 1-2: Integrate with setup-smart.py
- Day 3-4: Update documentation
- Day 5: Final testing and refinement

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
1. **Agent Availability**: Agents can be invoked immediately after deployment
2. **No Restart Required**: Claude recognizes agents without session restart
3. **Persistent Access**: Agents remain available across conversations

### Functional Success
1. **Better Kickstarters**: 50% reduction in setup time
2. **Compliance**: 90%+ projects pass validation on first try
3. **Language Support**: Python projects get specific guidance
4. **Automation**: One-command project initialization works

## Technical Considerations

### Agent File Structure
```
claude/agents/
├── sdlc/
│   ├── kickstart-architect.md
│   ├── framework-validator.md
│   └── project-bootstrapper.md
├── mining/
│   └── retrospective-miner.md
└── languages/
    └── python/
        └── language-python-expert.md
```

### Deployment Locations to Test
1. `~/claude/agents/` (user home)
2. `.claude/agents/` (project local)
3. `claude/agents/` (project subdirectory)
4. System locations (if accessible)

### Metadata Requirements
- Does `.agent-manifest.json` need updating?
- Are there hidden index files?
- Do we need specific file permissions?

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **High**: Agent deployment might not work at all
- **Medium**: Might work but require session restart
- **Low**: Might work inconsistently

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Fallback Plan**: Document manual installation steps
2. **Alternative**: Create web-based agent installer
3. **Workaround**: Pre-install common agents in setup

## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case
- Agents can be deployed dynamically
- Immediate availability in Claude
- Enables true adaptive framework

### Acceptable Case
- Agents require session restart
- But automated deployment still works
- One-time setup inconvenience

### Worst Case
- Manual installation only
- Document process clearly
- Focus on agent quality over deployment

## Future Extensions

If dynamic deployment works:
1. **Auto-updating agents**: Agents that improve themselves
2. **Project-specific agents**: Generated based on project needs
3. **Team agents**: Agents that learn team patterns
4. **Evolution tracking**: Agents that evolve with framework

## Questions to Answer

1. **File System Access**: What directories can Python write to?
2. **Claude's Agent Discovery**: How does Claude find agents?
3. **Caching**: Does Claude cache agent lists?
4. **Permissions**: What file permissions are required?
5. **Timing**: Is there a delay in agent recognition?

## Conclusion

This proposal serves dual purposes:
1. Adds valuable SDLC-specific agents to improve the framework
2. Tests the feasibility of dynamic agent deployment

Even if dynamic deployment fails, the agents themselves provide significant value. If it succeeds, it opens possibilities for adaptive, self-improving frameworks that get better with every project they help create.

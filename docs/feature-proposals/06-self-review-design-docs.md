# Feature Proposal: Self-Review Process and Design Documentation Standards

**Date:** 2025-07-17  
**Author:** Claude (AI Agent)  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Target Branch:** `feature/self-review-design-docs`

## Summary

Introduce a mandatory self-review process for all artifact creation and establish clear design documentation standards to prevent AI agents from writing implementation code when design specifications are needed. This addresses two critical issues observed in projects using the framework: excessive code generation in design phases and quality gaps in initial artifact creation.

## Motivation

Projects using the AI-First SDLC framework have encountered two significant issues:

1. **Over-coding in Design Phase**: AI agents frequently write extensive implementation code when asked to create design documentation, mixing the "HOW" with the "WHAT" and "WHY"
2. **Quality Gaps**: Initial artifacts often miss requirements or contain inconsistencies that could be caught through systematic self-review

The self-review process has been tested in several projects with significant quality improvements. By requiring AI agents to review their work against original requirements before presenting it, we catch gaps, inconsistencies, and misalignments early.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept: Self-Review Workflow

Establish a mandatory cycle for all artifact creation:
```
Understand Requirements → Create Artifact → Self-Review → (If gaps) Revise → Present
```

### Two-Phase Implementation

**Phase 1: Self-Review Process Foundation**
- Embed self-review as a core principle in CLAUDE.md
- Update all templates to include review checkpoints
- Create clear examples of the review process
- Make it clear this happens silently (user sees only final artifact)

**Phase 2: Design Documentation Standards**
- Create design-specific templates that make code-writing difficult
- Define clear boundaries between design and implementation
- Add validation warnings for code-heavy design documents
- Provide extensive examples of good design documentation

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Self-Review Process

#### Updates to CLAUDE.md
```markdown
## Self-Review Process (MANDATORY)

For ALL artifact creation (proposals, plans, designs, code, tests):

1. **Create Complete Artifact**: Write the entire document/code/test
2. **Self-Review Against Requirements**: 
   - Does this fully address the original request?
   - Are all requirements covered?
   - Is it consistent and clear?
   - Is the level of detail appropriate?
3. **Revise if Needed**: If gaps found, revise the artifact
4. **Iterate**: Repeat steps 2-3 until confident
5. **Present Final Version**: Only show the user the reviewed version

Note: This review process is internal - do not show review comments to the user.
```

#### Review Checkpoints in Templates
Add to all templates:
```markdown
<!-- SELF-REVIEW CHECKPOINT
Before finalizing, verify:
- All sections from the template are addressed
- Content aligns with stated objectives
- Technical details are accurate
- No contradictions or gaps exist
-->
```

### Phase 2: Design Documentation Standards

#### New Template: design-documentation.md
```markdown
# Design Documentation: [Feature Name]

## Overview
[What is being designed and why - business context]

## Functional Specifications
### User Stories
[As a... I want... So that...]

### Business Rules
[Clear rules and constraints]

### Acceptance Criteria
[Measurable success criteria]

## Architecture Design
### Component Overview
[High-level components - use diagrams]

### Data Flow
[How data moves through the system - use diagrams]

### Integration Points
[External systems and APIs]

## Visual/UX Specifications
[Mockups, wireframes, interaction patterns]

## Behavioral Specifications
### State Management
[States and transitions - use diagrams]

### Validation Rules
[What to validate, not how]

### Error Handling Strategy
[Types of errors and user experience]

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Performance
[Response times, throughput needs]

### Security
[Security requirements, not implementations]

### Scalability
[Expected growth and load]

<!-- WARNING: This is DESIGN documentation
- DO NOT include source code
- DO NOT detail implementation algorithms  
- DO NOT specify framework-specific patterns
Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
-->
```

#### Validation Pipeline Enhancement
Add new check to `validate-pipeline.py`:
```python
def check_design_documentation(self):
    """Check design docs for excessive implementation details"""
    design_files = glob.glob('**/design-*.md', recursive=True)
    
    for file in design_files:
        content = Path(file).read_text()
        
        # Count code blocks
        code_blocks = len(re.findall(r'```(?!mermaid|diagram)', content))
        total_lines = len(content.splitlines())
        code_lines = len(re.findall(r'```[\s\S]*?```', content))
        
        code_ratio = code_lines / total_lines if total_lines > 0 else 0
        
        if code_ratio > 0.2:  # More than 20% code
            self.add_warning(
                "Design Documentation", 
                f"{file} contains {code_ratio:.0%} code",
                "Consider moving implementation details to separate docs"
            )
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] AI agents consistently self-review before presenting artifacts
- [ ] Design documentation contains <20% implementation code
- [ ] Quality issues caught in self-review, not by users
- [ ] Clear separation between design "WHAT/WHY" and implementation "HOW"
- [ ] Validation pipeline warns about code-heavy design docs

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI agents skip review to save time | Make it mandatory in CLAUDE.md, emphasize quality |
| Review becomes perfunctory | Provide specific review questions and examples |
| Design docs too abstract | Include diagram examples and templates |
| Slows down development | Emphasize catching issues early saves time overall |

## Estimated Effort

- Phase 1 (Self-Review): 3-4 hours
  - Update CLAUDE.md and templates
  - Create examples
  - Test workflow
  
- Phase 2 (Design Standards): 4-5 hours
  - Create design templates
  - Add validation checks
  - Create comprehensive examples
  - Update documentation

Total: 7-9 hours (1-2 days)

## Dependencies

- None for Phase 1
- Phase 2 benefits from Phase 1 being complete (self-review helps ensure good design docs)

## Rollout Strategy

1. **Phase 1 First**: Establish self-review culture
2. **Monitor Adoption**: Ensure AI agents follow the process
3. **Phase 2 Rollout**: Add design standards once review is habitual
4. **Gather Feedback**: Refine based on real usage

## Future Enhancements

1. **Review Metrics**: Track how many review cycles typically needed
2. **Template Library**: Build collection of good design examples
3. **AI Training Data**: Use good examples to train future AI agents
4. **Automated Checks**: More sophisticated code detection in design docs

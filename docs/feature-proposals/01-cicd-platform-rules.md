# Feature Proposal: CI/CD Platform Rules Implementation

**Proposal Number:** 01  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** Claude (AI Assistant)  
**Created:** 2025-07-12  
**Target Branch:** `feature/cicd-platform-rules`  
**Implementation Type:** Infrastructure

---

## Executive Summary

Implement comprehensive CI/CD configuration files and documentation for multiple platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps) to enable the AI-First SDLC validation pipeline across different development environments. This will expand the framework's reach beyond GitHub-only teams.

---

## Motivation

### Problem Statement

- Currently, only GitHub Actions example is provided in `examples/ci-cd/`
- Teams using GitLab, Jenkins, or Azure DevOps must manually translate the validation pipeline
- No clear documentation on how to integrate the validation tools with different CI/CD platforms
- Risk of inconsistent implementation across different platforms

### User Stories

- As a GitLab user, I want GitLab CI configuration so that I can enforce AI-First SDLC practices in my pipelines
- As a Jenkins administrator, I want Jenkinsfile examples so that I can integrate the validation tools
- As an Azure DevOps team, I want azure-pipelines.yml configuration so that we can adopt the framework
- As a developer, I want platform-specific documentation so that I can quickly set up CI/CD validation

---

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Approach

Create CI/CD configuration files for major platforms that run the AI-First SDLC validation pipeline, along with platform-specific documentation explaining integration patterns and best practices.

### Technical Approach

1. **Create Platform-Specific Configurations**:
   - GitLab CI: `.gitlab-ci.yml`
   - Jenkins: `Jenkinsfile` (declarative pipeline)
   - Azure DevOps: `azure-pipelines.yml`
   - CircleCI: `.circleci/config.yml`

2. **Standardize Validation Steps**:
   - Environment setup (Python, dependencies)
   - Run `validate-pipeline.py` with appropriate flags
   - Feature proposal validation for PRs/MRs
   - Pre-commit hooks execution
   - Results reporting in platform-native format

3. **Documentation Structure**:
   - Platform-specific setup guides
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Secret management patterns
   - Integration with platform features (artifacts, caching)

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Docker-based Solution**: Package validation tools in Docker
   - Pros: Platform-agnostic, consistent environment
   - Cons: Requires Docker support, slower startup
   - Why not chosen: Not all CI environments support Docker

2. **Shell Script Wrapper**: Single script that detects CI platform
   - Pros: One file to maintain
   - Cons: Complex logic, harder to customize per platform
   - Why not chosen: Platform-specific features would be lost

## Implementation Plan

### Estimated Effort

- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 3-4 days
- **Required Skills**: CI/CD platforms, YAML, Python environments

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Research & Planning
- [x] Analyze existing GitHub Actions implementation
- [ ] Research platform-specific CI/CD best practices
- [ ] Identify common patterns across platforms

#### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Create GitLab CI configuration
- [ ] Create Jenkins declarative pipeline
- [ ] Create Azure DevOps pipeline
- [ ] Create CircleCI configuration
- [ ] Add platform detection to validation tools

#### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Test each configuration in example projects
- [ ] Write platform-specific setup guides
- [ ] Create troubleshooting documentation
- [ ] Add CI/CD section to QUICK-REFERENCE.md

### Dependencies

- **Technical Dependencies**: None (uses existing validation tools)
- **Team Dependencies**: None
- **External Dependencies**: Access to CI/CD platforms for testing

---

## Success Criteria

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GitLab CI configuration successfully runs validation pipeline
- [ ] Jenkins pipeline executes all validation steps
- [ ] Azure DevOps pipeline integrates with PR policies
- [ ] CircleCI configuration handles parallel job execution
- [ ] All configurations support the `--ci` flag for proper exit codes
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains platform-specific setup

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**:
- Validation tools already have tests

**Integration Tests**:
- Run each CI/CD configuration against example projects
- Verify failure scenarios (missing proposals, wrong branch)
- Test with different Python versions

**Manual Testing**:
- Create PRs/MRs on each platform
- Verify status checks integrate properly
- Test secret/environment variable handling

### Performance Criteria

- Pipeline execution time: < 5 minutes for standard project
- Parallel execution where platform supports it
- Efficient caching of Python dependencies

---

## Security & Privacy Considerations

### Security Impact

- **Authentication/Authorization changes**: None
- **Data exposure risks**: Ensure no secrets in pipeline logs
- **Input validation needs**: Already handled by validation tools

### Privacy Impact

- **Personal data handling**: No personal data processed
- **Compliance requirements**: N/A
- **Data retention changes**: Platform-default log retention

---

## Rollout Strategy

### Feature Flags

- No feature flags needed (opt-in by using configurations)

### Migration Plan

- **Data migration required**: No
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintained (existing GitHub Actions unchanged)
- **Deprecation timeline**: None

### Communication Plan

- **Internal announcement**: Update README with new platform support
- **User notification**: Blog post/release notes
- **Documentation updates**: New docs/ci-cd-platforms.md file

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Platform API changes | Low | Medium | Version-lock CI/CD syntax where possible |
| Python version incompatibility | Medium | Low | Test with Python 3.8-3.12 |
| Platform-specific limitations | Medium | Medium | Document workarounds in setup guides |

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we support self-hosted runner configurations?
- [ ] How to handle platform-specific features (e.g., GitLab's DAG pipelines)?
- [ ] Should we create a GitHub Action/GitLab template for easier adoption?

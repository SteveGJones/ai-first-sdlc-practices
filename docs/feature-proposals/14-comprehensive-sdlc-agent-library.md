   - Dependency resolution and checking
   - Language-specific agent selection
   - Manifest tracking of installed agents

2. **Agent Validator** (`tools/validation/validate-agents.py`)
   - YAML frontmatter validation
   - Required field checking
   - Dependency verification
   - Content quality checks
   - Manifest generation

3. **Release Builder** (`tools/automation/build-agent-release.py`)
   - Automated validation before release
   - Release package creation
   - Manifest and index generation
   - Version tracking

### Integration with Setup Process

The agent system is now integrated into `setup-smart.py`:
- Automatically downloads core agents during project setup
- Detects project language and suggests appropriate agents
- Creates `.agent-manifest.json` to track installed agents
- Provides clear next steps for exploring agents

### Release Structure

```
release/
â”œâ”€â”€ agent-manifest.json      # Complete agent inventory
â”œâ”€â”€ agent-version.json       # Version tracking
â””â”€â”€ agents/
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # User documentation
    â”œâ”€â”€ core/               # Essential agents
    â””â”€â”€ languages/          # Language-specific agents
```

### Usage Instructions

After setup, users can:
1. View installed agents in `claude/agents/`
2. Invoke agents with `@agent-name` syntax
3. Install additional agents with the installer tool
4. Validate custom agents before deployment

## Conclusion

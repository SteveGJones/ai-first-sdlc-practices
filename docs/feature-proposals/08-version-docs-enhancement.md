# Feature Proposal: Version Documentation Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Author:** Claude (AI Agent)  
**Target Branch:** `feature/version-docs-enhancement`  
**Related Issues:** Post-implementation review of PR #20

---

## Executive Summary

Enhance version management documentation to ensure AI agents fully understand the AI-first update philosophy and can correctly handle edge cases like bootstrap scenarios and sequential updates.

---

## Motivation

### Problem Statement

The recently implemented version management system (PR #20) has functional documentation, but post-implementation review identified several gaps that could confuse AI agents:

1. **Missing Philosophy Context**: No explanation of WHY we use prompts instead of scripts
2. **Bootstrap Problem**: No guidance for existing installations without VERSION file
3. **Sequential Updates**: Unclear how to apply multiple version updates in sequence
4. **Failure Handling**: Limited troubleshooting guidance in migration guides

### Impact
- AI agents might suggest creating update scripts (violating AI-first principle)
- Confusion handling pre-1.3.0 installations
- Uncertainty when applying multiple sequential updates
- No clear guidance when updates fail

### User Stories

- As an AI agent, I want to understand WHY updates use prompts so that I don't suggest automating with scripts
- As an AI agent, I want clear bootstrap instructions so that I can handle pre-VERSION installations
- As an AI agent, I want sequential update examples so that I can correctly apply multiple updates
- As an AI agent, I want comprehensive troubleshooting so that I can handle failures gracefully

## Proposed Solution

### Overview
Add comprehensive documentation enhancements to CLAUDE.md and migration guides that explicitly address all identified gaps.

### Key Components

1. **AI-First Philosophy Section**
   - Explain WHY updates use prompts, not scripts
   - Reinforce AI agents as primary actors
   - Prevent suggestions to automate with scripts

2. **Bootstrap Instructions**
   - Version detection for pre-VERSION installations
   - Feature-based version identification
   - Clear starting point determination

3. **Sequential Update Examples**
   - Multi-version update scenarios
   - Step-by-step progression
   - VERSION update only at end

4. **Enhanced Troubleshooting**
   - Download failure handling
   - Verification failure procedures
   - Alternative methods (wget)
   - Clear stop conditions

### Technical Approach
- Edit CLAUDE.md to add new sections
- Update both existing migration guides
- Maintain consistency across all documentation

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Clarity**: AI agents understand WHY and HOW of update system
2. **Completeness**: All edge cases documented
3. **Consistency**: Troubleshooting in all guides
4. **Actionability**: Clear steps for every scenario

---

## Implementation Plan

1. **Update CLAUDE.md** (10 minutes)
   - Add philosophy section
   - Add bootstrap section
   - Add sequential example
   - Add troubleshooting

2. **Update Migration Guides** (10 minutes)
   - Add troubleshooting to v1.3.0-to-v1.4.0.md
   - Add troubleshooting to v1.4.0-to-v1.5.0.md

3. **Create Retrospective** (10 minutes)
   - Document changes made
   - Capture learnings

---

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risks
1. **Over-documentation**: Making updates seem complex
2. **Inconsistency**: Different troubleshooting approaches

### Mitigation
1. Keep examples concise and practical
2. Use consistent troubleshooting template

---

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Minimal Changes**: Only add philosophy explanation
   - Rejected: Doesn't address all gaps

2. **Separate Troubleshooting Doc**: Create dedicated guide
   - Rejected: Better to have inline with migrations

3. **Automated Detection Script**: Create version detection tool
   - Rejected: Violates AI-first principle

## Open Questions

None - requirements are clear from review feedback.

## Appendix

### Example Bootstrap Detection
```bash
# Check for v1.2.0 features
grep -q "Self-Review Process" CLAUDE.md && echo "At least v1.2.0"

# Check for v1.1.0 features  
ls examples/ci-cd/ 2>/dev/null && echo "At least v1.1.0"
```

### Example Sequential Update
```bash
# From 1.3.0 to 1.5.0
curl -s .../v1.3.0-to-v1.4.0.md  # Apply first
curl -s .../v1.4.0-to-v1.5.0.md  # Apply second
echo "1.5.0" > VERSION           # Update once
```

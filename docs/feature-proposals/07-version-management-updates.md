# Feature Proposal: AI-First Version Management and Update System

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Author:** Claude (AI Agent)  
**Status:** Revised  
**Target Branch:** `feature/version-management-updates`

## Summary

Implement an AI-first version management system that provides Claude (or other AI agents) with clear instructions to discover, understand, and apply framework updates. This maintains the paradigm where AI agents are the primary developers, not just users of automated tools.

## Motivation

As the user correctly identified, the original proposal had a fundamental flaw:
- It proposed a Python script that would automatically update files
- This bypasses the AI agent, breaking the AI-first paradigm
- We need to **inform** Claude about updates, not execute them automatically

The core insight: **Claude is the developer**, not a consumer of our automation. The update system should provide instructions for Claude to follow, maintaining the same pattern as our installation process.

Current gaps:
1. No way for Claude to check the current framework version
2. No standardized prompt for users to request updates
3. No clear instructions for Claude to follow when updating
4. No verification process Claude can use to confirm success

## Proposed Solution

### AI-First Update Architecture

```
├── VERSION                     # Version tracking file
├── CHANGELOG.md               # Human-readable changelog
├── docs/
│   ├── releases/             # AI-readable migration instructions
│   │   └── vX.Y.Z-*.md      # Step-by-step for Claude
│   └── updates/             
│       ├── whats-new.md    # Recent changes summary
│       └── UPDATE-PROMPT.md # Standard prompt for users
└── tools/
    └── verify-update.py     # Verification helper for Claude
```

### Core Components

1. **Version Tracking**
   - `VERSION` file in every installation
   - Simple format Claude can read: "1.5.0"
   - Setup script creates initial VERSION

2. **Update Prompt Template**
   - Standardized prompt users give to Claude
   - Similar to installation prompt pattern
   - Clear, copy-paste ready

3. **Claude-Readable Instructions**
   - Migration guides written FOR Claude
   - Explicit file lists with curl commands
   - Verification steps Claude can execute
   - Success criteria Claude can check

4. **Discovery Mechanism**
   - Claude checks VERSION files
   - Compares local vs remote
   - Reads appropriate migration guide
   - Reports findings to user

## Implementation Details

### Standard Update Prompt (UPDATE-PROMPT.md)
```markdown
I want to check for AI-First SDLC framework updates. Please:

1. Check current version: cat VERSION
2. Check latest: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteveGJones/ai-first-sdlc-practices/main/VERSION
3. If update available:
   - Read migration guide: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../docs/releases/v{VERSION}-*.md
   - Follow the instructions in that guide
   - Update VERSION file when complete
4. Report what changed
```

### Migration Guide Format (for Claude)
```markdown
# Migration Guide: v1.4.0 to v1.5.0

## Overview
[Brief description for Claude]

## Files to Update

### 1. Update CLAUDE.md
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../CLAUDE.md > CLAUDE.md
```

### 2. Update Templates
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../templates/feature-proposal.md > templates/feature-proposal.md
# ... more files
```

## Verification Steps
1. Check that CLAUDE.md contains "Self-Review Process"
2. Verify templates have review checkpoints
3. Run: python tools/validation/validate-pipeline.py

## Update VERSION
```bash
echo "1.5.0" > VERSION
```
```

### Information Flow
```
User gives update prompt to Claude
    ├─> Claude checks current VERSION
    ├─> Claude fetches latest VERSION
    ├─> Claude compares versions
    ├─> Claude reads migration guide
    ├─> Claude executes update commands
    ├─> Claude verifies success
    └─> Claude reports to user
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Claude can check framework version with simple command
- [ ] Users have clear prompt to give Claude for updates
- [ ] Claude can successfully apply updates following guides
- [ ] Migration guides are written for AI comprehension
- [ ] Verification steps confirm successful updates
- [ ] Process maintains AI-first philosophy

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Claude misunderstands instructions | High | Clear, explicit commands with examples |
| Partial updates | Medium | Verification steps after each change |
| Network failures | Low | Claude reports specific failures |
| User gives wrong prompt | Low | Standardized prompt template |

## Estimated Effort

- Version infrastructure: 1 hour
- Update prompt template: 1 hour
- Migration guide templates: 2 hours
- Rewrite existing guides for Claude: 2 hours
- Testing with Claude: 2 hours

Total: 1 day

## Dependencies

- VERSION file in setup-smart.py
- Migration guides written for AI agents
- No Python dependencies (Claude does the work)

## Rollout Strategy

1. Add VERSION to new installations
2. Create UPDATE-PROMPT.md template
3. Rewrite migration guides for Claude
4. Test with Claude on real updates
5. Add to README with clear instructions
6. Announce new update process

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smart Detection**: Claude infers version from file signatures
2. **Selective Updates**: Claude asks user which components to update
3. **Update Reminders**: Validation pipeline reminds about updates
4. **Batch Operations**: Claude updates multiple projects
5. **Custom Prompts**: Organization-specific update workflows

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Automated Python Script**: Rejected - breaks AI-first paradigm
2. **Git Submodules**: Rejected - too complex for Claude
3. **Web Dashboard**: Rejected - adds infrastructure
4. **Config Management**: Rejected - overkill for simple updates

## Key Insight

The user identified the critical flaw: we were designing a traditional update system when we need an AI-first approach. Just as installation uses a prompt to Claude, updates should too. This maintains consistency and keeps Claude as the primary developer, not a consumer of our automation.

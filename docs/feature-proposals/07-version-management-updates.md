# Feature Proposal: Version Management and Update Infrastructure

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Author:** Claude (AI Agent)  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Target Branch:** `feature/version-management-updates`

## Summary

Implement a comprehensive version management and update infrastructure to help existing framework users discover, understand, and apply updates as the framework evolves. This addresses the gap between new users (who get current version) and existing users (who need migration support).

## Motivation

As discussed with the user, we have a critical challenge:
- New users get the latest version automatically via setup script
- Existing users have no clear way to discover or apply updates
- The framework is evolving rapidly with new features
- Users need both discovery mechanisms and migration support

Currently, there's no way for existing users to:
1. Know their current framework version
2. Discover what updates are available
3. Understand what changed between versions
4. Apply updates safely with migration support

## Proposed Solution

### Multi-Tiered Information Architecture

```
├── VERSION                     # Version tracking file
├── CHANGELOG.md               # Standard changelog
├── docs/
│   ├── releases/             # Detailed migration guides
│   │   └── vX.Y.Z-*.md      # Per-release guides
│   └── updates/             # Quick reference
│       └── whats-new.md    # Recent highlights
└── tools/
    └── update-framework.py  # Automated updater
```

### Core Components

1. **Version Tracking**
   - `VERSION` file in every installation
   - Semantic versioning (X.Y.Z)
   - Setup script writes current version

2. **Discovery Mechanisms**
   - "What's New" section in README
   - Dedicated what's-new.md page
   - Update script shows available updates

3. **Update Automation**
   - Check current vs latest version
   - Show release summaries
   - Download updated files
   - Preserve user customizations

4. **Migration Support**
   - Step-by-step guides per release
   - Breaking change warnings
   - Rollback procedures
   - Example implementations

## Implementation Details

### VERSION File
```
1.5.0
```
Simple, parseable, trackable.

### Update Script Features
- Detect framework installation
- Compare versions
- Show changelog summary
- Download updates selectively
- Update VERSION file
- Show next steps

### Information Flow
```
User runs update-framework.py
    ├─> Checks current VERSION
    ├─> Fetches latest VERSION from GitHub
    ├─> Shows releases between versions
    ├─> Offers to apply updates
    └─> Updates files and VERSION
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can check their framework version easily
- [ ] Update discovery is obvious and accessible
- [ ] Migration guides prevent breaking changes
- [ ] Update process is safe and reversible
- [ ] Works across all supported platforms

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Breaking user customizations | High | Selective file updates, preserve custom files |
| Version conflicts | Medium | Clear compatibility matrix |
| Network dependencies | Low | Graceful offline handling |
| Update failures | Medium | Atomic updates, rollback support |

## Estimated Effort

- Version infrastructure: 2 hours
- Update script: 3-4 hours
- Documentation: 2 hours
- Testing: 2 hours

Total: 1-2 days

## Dependencies

- Requires VERSION in setup-smart.py
- GitHub API for version checking
- Python standard library only

## Rollout Strategy

1. Add VERSION to new installations
2. Create update infrastructure
3. Document in README
4. Announce to existing users
5. Monitor adoption and feedback

## Future Enhancements

1. **Version Detection** for pre-VERSION installations
2. **Selective Updates** (security only, features only)
3. **Update Notifications** in validation pipeline
4. **Dependency Management** for tool versions
5. **Automated Changelog** generation from PRs

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Git Tags Only**: Rejected - not visible in installations
2. **Package Manager**: Rejected - adds dependencies
3. **Manual Only**: Rejected - poor user experience
4. **Config File**: Rejected - VERSION simpler

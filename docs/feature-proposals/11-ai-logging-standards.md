# Feature Proposal: AI-First Logging Standards and Enforcement

**Feature ID**: 11
**Title**: Comprehensive Logging Standards for AI-Generated Code
**Author**: AI Agent (with ai-solution-architect and critical-goal-reviewer input)
**Date**: 2025-07-27
**Status**: Proposed
Target Branch: `feature/ai-logging-standards`

## Motivation

AI agents (like Claude) consistently fail to add proper logging to code, making debugging and production support extremely difficult. When issues occur, the lack of observability leads to extended downtime and frustrated developers. This feature will establish mandatory logging standards and enforce them through the Zero Technical Debt policy.

## Problem Statement

Current issues with AI-generated code:
1. **No logging at all** - Most generated code lacks any logging
2. **No guidance on WHERE** - AI agents don't know where logs are mandatory
3. **No quality standards** - When logs exist, they're often useless ("entered function")
4. **Security risks** - No guidance on avoiding sensitive data in logs
5. **Performance blind spots** - No consideration of logging overhead

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Mandatory Logging Points (The "WHERE")

Define 6 specific locations where logging is REQUIRED:

#### 1.1 Function/Method Boundaries
```python
# GOOD - Informative entry/exit
logger.info("Creating user", extra={"username": username, "email_domain": email.split('@')[1]})
# ... function body ...
logger.info("User created successfully", extra={"user_id": user.id, "duration_ms": elapsed})

# BAD - Useless logging
logger.info("entered function")
logger.info("exiting")
```

#### 1.2 Error Handling
```python
# GOOD - Full context
logger.error("Failed to create user", extra={
    "username": username,
    "error_type": type(e).__name__,
    "error_message": str(e)
}, exc_info=True)

# BAD - No context
logger.error("Error occurred")
```

#### 1.3 External Integrations
```python
# GOOD - Traceable
logger.info("Calling payment API", extra={"endpoint": "/charge", "amount": amount, "currency": "USD"})
response = payment_api.charge(...)
logger.info("Payment API response", extra={"status": response.status, "transaction_id": response.id})

# BAD - No correlation
payment_api.charge(...)
```

#### 1.4 State Changes
```python
# GOOD - Audit trail
logger.info("User permission changed", extra={
    "user_id": user.id,
    "old_role": old_role,
    "new_role": new_role,
    "changed_by": admin.id
})

# BAD - No record
user.role = new_role
```

#### 1.5 Security Events
```python
# GOOD - Security monitoring
logger.warning("Failed login attempt", extra={
    "username": username,
    "ip_address": request.ip,
    "attempt_count": attempts
})

# BAD - No security context
logger.info("login failed")
```

#### 1.6 Business Logic Milestones
```python
# GOOD - Business metrics
logger.info("Order processing milestone", extra={
    "order_id": order.id,
    "stage": "payment_completed",
    "amount": order.total
})

# BAD - No business value
logger.debug("step 3 done")
```

### 2. Logging Quality Standards

#### Log Level Requirements
- **ERROR**: System failures, unrecoverable errors (with stack trace)
- **WARN**: Recoverable issues, degraded performance, security concerns
- **INFO**: Business events, state changes, external calls, milestones
- **DEBUG**: Detailed flow, variable states (NEVER in production)

#### Structured Logging Format (MANDATORY)
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "logger": "UserService",
  "method": "createUser",
  "request_id": "abc-123",  // REQUIRED for tracing
  "message": "User creation initiated",
  "duration_ms": 45,        // REQUIRED if >100ms
  "context": {              // Domain-specific data
    "user_id": "user-456",
    "action": "create"
  }
}
```

#### Performance Guidelines
- Skip logging for:
  - Simple getters/setters
  - Pure functions without side effects
  - High-frequency operations (>1000/sec) without sampling
- Use async logging for file output
- Configure log rotation and retention

### 3. Security Requirements

#### FORBIDDEN in Logs:
- Passwords, tokens, API keys
- Full credit card numbers (last 4 digits OK)
- Social security numbers
- Personal health information
- Full email addresses in bulk operations

#### Required Sanitization:
```python
# GOOD
logger.info("User login", extra={
    "username": username,
    "email_domain": email.split('@')[1]  # Not full email
})

# BAD
logger.info(f"Login: {username} / {password}")  # NEVER log passwords
```

### 4. Validation and Enforcement

#### New Validation Tool
`tools/validation/check-logging-compliance.py` will:
1. Parse code to find functions/methods
2. Check for logging at mandatory points
3. Verify log quality (not just presence)
4. Detect sensitive data patterns
5. Fail with specific guidance on what's missing

#### Integration with Zero Technical Debt
- Missing logs = Technical debt = Build failure
- Poor quality logs = Technical debt = Build failure  
- Sensitive data in logs = Security debt = Build failure

#### Exemption Configuration
```yaml
# .logging-config.yaml
exemptions:
  - pattern: "get*"
    reason: "Simple getters don't need logging"
  - pattern: "*_test.py"
    reason: "Test files have different logging needs"
  - file: "src/utils/pure_functions.py"
    reason: "Pure mathematical functions"
```

### 5. Language-Specific Implementation

Provide examples and validators for:
- Python (with logging, structlog)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (with winston, pino)
- Go (with zap, logrus)
- Java (with slf4j, log4j2)
- Rust (with tracing, log)

### 6. Architecture Document Addition

Add as 7th mandatory document: `observability-design.md`
- Logging strategy
- Metrics collection
- Distributed tracing
- Alert thresholds
- Retention policies

## Technical Specifications

### Validation Algorithm
1. Parse source files into AST
2. Identify functions/methods
3. For each function, check:
   - Has entry log? (quality check)
   - Has exit log? (if >10 lines)
   - Has error logs in catch blocks?
   - Has logs near external calls?
   - No sensitive patterns?
4. Report violations with specific line numbers

### Configuration
```yaml
logging:
  min_level: INFO
  structured: true
  require_request_id: true
  performance_threshold_ms: 100
  sensitive_patterns:
    - password
    - token
    - api_key
    - credit_card
  exemptions:
    - simple_getters
    - pure_functions
```

## Benefits

1. **Debuggability**: Every production issue becomes traceable
2. **Observability**: Full visibility into system behavior
3. **Security**: Audit trail for all security events
4. **Performance**: Identify bottlenecks through duration logging
5. **Business Intelligence**: Derive metrics from structured logs

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Over-logging | Performance degradation | Clear exemptions, sampling guidance |
| Checkbox compliance | Useless logs | Quality validation, not just presence |
| Sensitive data leaks | Security breach | Automated sensitive pattern detection |
| Developer friction | Resistance to adoption | Smart exemptions, clear value prop |

## Success Criteria

1. **AI Behavior Change**: 90%+ of AI-generated functions include proper logging
2. **Log Quality**: 95%+ of logs provide actionable information
3. **Security**: Zero sensitive data in logs
4. **Performance**: <1% overhead from logging
5. **Debugging Time**: 50% reduction in time to root cause

## Migration Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Add validation tool (without enforcement)
2. **Phase 2**: Add to CLAUDE-CORE.md instructions
3. **Phase 3**: Enable warnings in validation pipeline
4. **Phase 4**: Make it a blocking check
5. **Phase 5**: Add to architecture requirements

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Post-generation log injection**: Rejected - doesn't teach AI agents
2. **Aspect-oriented logging**: Rejected - language-specific, magical
3. **Optional logging standards**: Rejected - won't change behavior
4. **Minimal requirements**: Rejected - results in poor quality logs

## Conclusion

This comprehensive logging standard transforms AI agents from producing unobservable code to creating production-ready, debuggable systems. By enforcing WHERE to log, WHAT to log, and HOW to log safely, we ensure that AI-generated code meets the same observability standards as human-written code.

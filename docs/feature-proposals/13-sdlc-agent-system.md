# Feature Proposal: SDLC Agent System

**Feature ID**: 13
**Title**: Comprehensive Agent System for AI-First SDLC
**Author**: AI Agent
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Status**: Proposed
Target Branch: `feature/sdlc-agent-system`

## Motivation

While Claude is a powerful general-purpose AI, software development requires specialized expertise across many domains. The AI-First SDLC would benefit from a library of specialized agents that can be invoked for specific tasks, similar to how human teams have specialists (architects, security experts, DBAs, etc.).

## Problem Statement

Current limitations:
1. **Generalist Approach**: One AI agent tries to handle all aspects of development
2. **Context Switching**: Difficult to maintain deep expertise across all domains
3. **Language Barriers**: Different languages have different idioms and best practices
4. **No Specialization**: Missing domain-specific knowledge (security, performance, etc.)
5. **Inconsistent Quality**: Varies based on the specific area of expertise

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Agent Taxonomy

Create a hierarchical system of specialized agents organized by:

#### Core Categories

```

### 2. Agent Definition Format

Each agent follows a structured format:

```yaml
---
name: security-architect
category: architecture
description: Expert in security architecture, threat modeling, and secure design patterns
expertise:
  - Threat modeling (STRIDE, PASTA)
  - Security patterns and anti-patterns
  - Authentication and authorization design
  - Cryptography best practices
  - Zero trust architecture
  - OWASP Top 10 mitigation
triggers:
  - security design
  - threat model
  - authentication system
  - encryption strategy
dependencies:
  - compliance/*  # May invoke compliance agents
color: red
version: 1.0.0
---

[Agent personality and detailed instructions...]
```

### 3. Agent Discovery System

#### Automatic Agent Selection
```python
# agents/discovery.py
class AgentDiscovery:
    def suggest_agents(self, task_description: str) -> List[Agent]:
        """Suggest relevant agents based on task"""
        # NLP analysis of task
        # Match against agent triggers
        # Return ranked list of agents
```

#### Manual Discovery
```bash
# List all agents
claude-agents list

# Search agents
claude-agents search "security"

# Show agent details
claude-agents info security-architect
```

### 4. Language-Specific Structure

Language agents have additional metadata:

```yaml
---
name: python-expert
category: languages/python
language: python
versions: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
frameworks:
  - django: "3.2+"
  - fastapi: "0.100+"
  - flask: "2.0+"
linting_tools:
  - flake8
  - black
  - mypy
  - ruff
---
```

### 5. Agent Composition

Agents can invoke other agents for specialized tasks:

```yaml
---
name: api-designer
dependencies:
  - security-architect    # For auth design
  - database-architect    # For data modeling
  - api-documenter       # For OpenAPI specs
---
```

### 6. Installation and Management

#### Selective Installation
```bash
# Install core agents only
python setup-smart.py --agents core

# Install with specific categories
python setup-smart.py --agents core,architecture,review

# Install language-specific
python setup-smart.py --agents languages/python
```

#### Agent Versioning
- Agents are versioned independently
- Can upgrade specific agents
- Backwards compatibility maintained

### 7. Integration with CLAUDE-CORE.md

Update context loading table:
```markdown
| Task | Load File | Suggested Agents |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| API Design | CLAUDE-CONTEXT-api.md | api-designer, security-architect |
| Code Review | CLAUDE-CONTEXT-review.md | code-quality-reviewer, [language]-expert |
| Testing | CLAUDE-CONTEXT-testing.md | test-strategist, unit-test-designer |
```

## Benefits

1. **Specialized Expertise**: Deep knowledge in specific domains
2. **Consistent Quality**: Each agent excels in its domain
3. **Scalability**: Add new agents without affecting existing ones
4. **Language Idioms**: Proper patterns for each language
5. **Discoverability**: Easy to find the right agent for the task
6. **Composability**: Agents can work together

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Agent format specification
- Discovery system
- Installation mechanism

### Phase 2: Essential Agents
- Core SDLC agents
- Basic architecture agents
- General code reviewers

### Phase 3: Specialized Agents
- Language-specific experts
- Framework specialists
- Compliance agents

### Phase 4: Community Agents
- Agent marketplace
- User-contributed agents
- Agent certification process

## Success Metrics

1. **Coverage**: 90% of SDLC tasks have specialized agents
2. **Usage**: Agents invoked in 80% of development sessions
3. **Quality**: Higher code quality metrics when agents used
4. **Efficiency**: 30% reduction in development time

## Example Usage

```python
# User request
"I need to design a REST API for user management with OAuth2"

# Claude's response
"I'll engage our specialized agents for this task:"
- api-designer: Overall API structure
- security-architect: OAuth2 implementation
- database-architect: User data model
- api-documenter: OpenAPI specification

# Agents collaborate to produce comprehensive design
```

## Migration Strategy

1. Start with manual agent invocation
2. Add automatic agent suggestion
3. Enable agent composition
4. Full autonomous agent orchestration

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Agent proliferation | Categorization and discovery system |
| Version conflicts | Semantic versioning and compatibility matrix |
| Performance overhead | Lazy loading and caching |
| Maintenance burden | Community contributions and automation |

## Conclusion

A comprehensive agent system transforms Claude from a generalist to a team of specialists, each excelling in their domain. This mirrors how human development teams work and ensures consistent, high-quality output across all aspects of the SDLC.

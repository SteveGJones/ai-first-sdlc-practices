# Feature Proposal: AI Builders Team Coaching System

## Motivation

AI agents need to be coached to legendary collaborative status. Current AI development lacks:
- Rapid project kickoff capabilities (teams waste crucial first minutes)
- Enforcement of professional standards (too many shortcuts taken)
- Team coordination patterns (agents work in silos)
- Billy Wright-style leadership principles
- Stan Cullis-level discipline enforcement

This proposal introduces a revolutionary coaching system that transforms AI agents into world-class collaborative teams through two complementary systems: the Kickoff Genius (5-minute miracle) and the SDLC Enforcer (zero tolerance standards).

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Kickoff Genius (`kickoff_genius.py`)
A 5-minute miracle system that transforms vague project ideas into actionable plans:
- **Minute 1**: Rapid Discovery - Billy Wright's 5 questions crystallize any idea
- **Minute 2**: Instant Team Assembly - Perfect AI agent selection
- **Minute 3**: Architecture Blueprint - Lightning-fast tech decisions
- **Minute 4**: Task Breakdown - Actionable items with time estimates
- **Minute 5**: Kickoff Execution - Launch commands ready

### 2. SDLC Enforcer (`sdlc_coach.py`)
Professional standards enforcement with zero tolerance:
- BLOCKS non-compliant work (no shortcuts)
- Enforces all 6 architecture documents
- Zero technical debt tolerance
- Validated agent teams only
- Continuous quality gates

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
```
User Input (vague idea)
    ↓
Kickoff Genius (5 minutes)
    ├─ Rapid Discovery → Clear Vision
    ├─ Team Assembly → Agent Selection
    ├─ Architecture → Tech Stack
    ├─ Task Breakdown → Work Items
    └─ Execution → Launch Commands
    ↓
SDLC Enforcer (continuous)
    ├─ Feature Proposal Check → BLOCK if missing
    ├─ Architecture Docs → BLOCK if incomplete
    ├─ Technical Debt → BLOCK if found
    ├─ Agent Validation → BLOCK if invalid
    └─ Quality Gates → Continuous enforcement
    ↓
Development Authorized (or BLOCKED)
```

### Key Components

1. **Rapid Discovery Engine**
   - Extracts clarity from vague ideas
   - Uses pattern matching and keywords
   - Generates specific project descriptions

2. **Team Formation Algorithm**
   - Selects core team based on project type
   - Adds enforcement agents (always)
   - Includes specialists based on requirements

3. **Architecture Decision Tree**
   - Frontend: React/React Native based on platform
   - Backend: Python/Node/Go based on requirements
   - Database: PostgreSQL with optional Redis/TimescaleDB
   - Deployment: Docker/Kubernetes based on scale

4. **Enforcement System**
   - Pre-development blocks for non-compliance
   - Continuous validation during development
   - Incremental retrospective updates
   - Zero tolerance for technical debt

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- Vague idea transformation accuracy
- Team selection appropriateness
- Architecture decision logic
- Enforcement blocking scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Full 5-minute workflow completion
- Enforcement integration with kickoff
- Validation pipeline compatibility
- Agent discovery and validation

### User Acceptance Tests
1. **Vague AI Project**: "I want to build something with AI"
   - Expected: AI-specific team with Python/FastAPI
2. **Data Analytics**: "thinking about analytics"
   - Expected: Data team with appropriate stack
3. **Generic Efficiency**: "help teams work better"
   - Expected: Standard team with flexible architecture
4. **Missing Documentation**: No feature proposal
   - Expected: BLOCKED with clear requirements
5. **Technical Debt Present**: TODOs in code
   - Expected: BLOCKED until resolved

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: PR Testing (Current)
- Branch available for third-party AI testing
- Clear testing instructions in PR
- Examples provided in documentation

### Phase 2: Early Adoption
- Merge to main after validation
- Update framework documentation
- Create video demonstrations

### Phase 3: Full Integration
- Add to AI-First SDLC setup process
- Include in agent discovery catalog
- Update all related documentation

### Phase 4: Continuous Improvement
- Gather feedback from AI agents
- Refine discovery patterns
- Expand architecture decisions
- Add more specialized teams

## Success Criteria

- **Speed**: Projects kickoff in <5 minutes (currently achieved: 0.0 seconds)
- **Clarity**: 100% of vague ideas transformed into specific plans
- **Compliance**: 100% enforcement of SDLC standards
- **Team Quality**: Appropriate agents selected for project type
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Reduced project startup friction

# Team Orchestration Quick Start Guide

> **From Zero to Perfect Team Formation in 15 Minutes**

## Overview

This quick start guide gets you from "I need help building software" to "I have the perfect AI team formation for my project" in under 15 minutes.

## Step 1: Discover Your Team (5 minutes)

```bash
# Run the interactive team discovery assessment
python tools/automation/team-discovery.py --interactive
```

**What happens**: You'll answer 7 strategic questions about your project, and the system will recommend your optimal formation pattern and agent lineup.

**Example Output**:
```
Recommended Formation: The Innovator (4-4-2)
Total Agents: 10
Phase 1 agents: sdlc-enforcer, ai-solution-architect, critical-goal-reviewer
```

## Step 2: Validate Team Readiness (3 minutes)

```bash
# Check if your recommended team is ready for action
python tools/automation/validate-team-readiness.py --formation innovator --quick
```

**What happens**: The system checks if you have the minimum viable team (Golden Triangle) and validates basic workflow functionality.

**If Ready**: ✅ Proceed to Step 4  
**If Not Ready**: Continue to Step 3

## Step 3: Build Team Chemistry (7 minutes)

```bash
# Start with the foundational chemistry exercise
python tools/automation/team-chemistry.py --exercise simple-feature-challenge --formation innovator
```

**What happens**: Your agents practice working together on a simulated feature, developing collaboration patterns and identifying improvement areas.

**Repeat as needed**: Run additional exercises based on recommendations until chemistry scores improve.

## Step 4: Monitor Team Performance (Ongoing)

```bash
# Launch the live team dashboard
python tools/automation/team-dashboard.py --formation innovator --live
```

**What happens**: Real-time dashboard shows team readiness, chemistry scores, active agents, and performance trends. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Project
```bash
# 1. Discover formation
python tools/automation/team-discovery.py --interactive

# 2. Install recommended agents (follow platform-specific instructions)

# 3. Validate readiness  
python tools/automation/validate-team-readiness.py --formation <type>

# 4. Run chemistry exercises
python tools/automation/team-chemistry.py --interactive --formation <type>

# 5. Monitor performance
python tools/automation/team-dashboard.py --live --formation <type>
```

### Optimizing Existing Team
```bash
# 1. Assess current state
python tools/automation/validate-team-readiness.py --formation <current> --verbose

# 2. Run chemistry assessment
python tools/automation/team-chemistry.py --assess --formation <current>

# 3. Get improvement recommendations
python tools/automation/team-chemistry.py --recommend --formation <current>

# 4. Run recommended exercises
python tools/automation/team-chemistry.py --exercise <recommended> --formation <current>
```

### Evolving Formation (Project Growth)
```bash
# 1. Re-assess project needs
python tools/automation/team-discovery.py --interactive

# 2. Compare with current formation
# If new formation recommended, plan migration

# 3. Install additional agents gradually
# 4. Re-validate readiness with new formation
# 5. Run chemistry exercises to integrate new agents
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Team Not Ready" - Low Readiness Score
**Cause**: Missing agents or basic workflow issues  
**Solution**: Install missing agents, fix framework setup
```bash
python tools/automation/validate-team-readiness.py --formation <type> --verbose
# Look for specific failures and address them
```

### "Poor Team Chemistry" - Low Chemistry Score  
**Cause**: Agents not collaborating effectively  
**Solution**: Run chemistry development exercises
```bash
python tools/automation/team-chemistry.py --exercise handoff-protocol --formation <type>
python tools/automation/team-chemistry.py --exercise simple-feature-challenge --formation <type>
```

### "Wrong Formation" - Team Struggles with Project Complexity
**Cause**: Formation doesn't match project needs  
**Solution**: Re-run team discovery, consider formation evolution
```bash
python tools/automation/team-discovery.py --interactive
# Compare results with current formation
```

### Agents Conflicting or Duplicating Work
**Cause**: Role clarity issues  
**Solution**: Run role clarity exercises, check formation structure
```bash
python tools/automation/team-chemistry.py --exercise role-clarity --formation <type>
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Formation Creation
If none of the standard formations fit your unique needs:

1. **Start with closest standard formation**
2. **Add/remove agents based on specific requirements**  
3. **Create custom chemistry exercises for your agent mix**
4. **Validate and iterate until team performs optimally**

### Multi-Project Team Management
For teams working on multiple projects:

1. **Use Orchestrator formation as base**
2. **Create project-specific agent subsets**  
3. **Implement project handoff protocols**
4. **Monitor cross-project chemistry metrics**

### Formation Evolution Patterns
```
MVP Launch:     Builder → Specialist
Product Growth: Specialist → Innovator (if AI features)
Scale Phase:    Specialist → Transformer (if integration heavy)
Platform Phase: Transformer → Orchestrator
AI Enhancement: Any → Innovator
```

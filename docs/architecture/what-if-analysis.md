# What-If Analysis

**Project:** AI-First SDLC Practices Framework  
**Date:** 2025-08-06  
**Version:** 1.6.0+  

**STOP**: Answer EVERY scenario before writing code.

## Scenario Analysis

#### What if load increases 100x?
- **Probability:** Medium (framework adoption growing rapidly)
- **Impact:** High (template system becomes I/O bound, setup failures)
- **Detection:** Monitoring setup success rates, performance metrics
- **Handling Strategy:** 
  - Implement async template processing
  - Add CDN for static assets
  - Create regional mirror repositories
- **Recovery:** Fallback to direct GitHub downloads, cached templates

#### What if GitHub becomes unavailable?
- **Probability:** Low (but high impact when occurs)
- **Impact:** Critical (all new installations fail, updates blocked)
- **Detection:** HTTP status checks, user reports, monitoring
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Mirror repositories on GitLab and other platforms
  - Local caching of framework files
  - Offline installation mode
- **Recovery:** Switch to mirror repositories, restore from local cache

#### What if malicious code is injected into templates?
- **Probability:** Low (but severe security risk)
- **Impact:** Critical (affects all users downloading templates)
- **Detection:** Code review, automated scanning, checksum validation
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Immediate template quarantine
  - Version rollback procedures
  - Security advisory to users
- **Recovery:** Clean template restoration, user notification system

#### What if setup-smart.py fails during installation?
- **Probability:** Medium (various environment issues)
- **Impact:** High (broken project setup, user frustration)
- **Detection:** Installation failure logs, automatic error reporting
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Atomic operations with rollback capability
  - Comprehensive error handling and diagnostics
  - Alternative installation methods
- **Recovery:** Automatic rollback to previous state, cleanup procedures

#### What if framework adoption grows 10x overnight?
- **Probability:** Medium (viral adoption scenarios)
- **Impact:** High (infrastructure strain, support burden)
- **Detection:** Download metrics, GitHub traffic, user reports
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Implement GitFlow for stable releases
  - Feature toggles for gradual rollout
  - Expanded contributor guidelines
- **Recovery:** Staged releases, canary deployments for major versions

#### What if AI development practices change completely?
- **Probability:** Medium (technology evolution)
- **Impact:** Medium (framework relevance, user migration)
- **Detection:** Industry trend monitoring, user feedback
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Modular design allows component replacement
  - Version migration scripts
  - Community feedback loops
- **Recovery:** 6-month adaptation cycle, backward compatibility

#### What if users can't install Python dependencies?
- **Probability:** Medium (environment compatibility issues)
- **Impact:** Medium (installation barriers, user adoption)
- **Detection:** Installation failure logs, user support requests
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Docker containers for isolated environments
  - Pre-built binaries for common platforms
  - Minimal dependency requirements
- **Recovery:** Alternative installation methods, environment validation

#### What if Claude/AI agents change their interfaces?
- **Probability:** High (rapid AI development)
- **Impact:** Medium (framework instructions need updates)
- **Detection:** Interface changes, user reports, testing
- **Handling Strategy:**
  - Interface abstraction layer
  - Multiple agent support
  - Prompt engineering updates
- **Recovery:** Compatibility testing, instruction updates

## Overview

This document analyzes ALL potential failure modes for each system component. For every component, we identify what can fail, how it can fail, and what happens when it fails. This analysis is MANDATORY before implementation.

## 🎯 Analysis Methodology

### Risk Priority Number (RPN) Calculation
**RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detection**

#### Severity Scale (1-10)
- **10**: Catastrophic - Complete system failure, data loss
- **8-9**: Critical - Major feature unavailable, security breach
- **6-7**: High - Significant degradation, data corruption risk
- **4-5**: Moderate - Feature degraded, workaround available
- **2-3**: Low - Minor inconvenience
- **1**: Negligible - No user impact

#### Occurrence Scale (1-10)
- **10**: Very High - Multiple times per day
- **8-9**: High - Daily
- **6-7**: Moderate - Weekly
- **4-5**: Low - Monthly
- **2-3**: Very Low - Quarterly
- **1**: Remote - Yearly or less

#### Detection Scale (1-10)
- **10**: Undetectable - No current detection method
- **8-9**: Very Low - Manual checking required
- **6-7**: Low - Detected by periodic monitoring
- **4-5**: Moderate - Detected by alerts (>5 min delay)
- **2-3**: High - Detected by real-time monitoring
- **1**: Very High - Prevented before occurrence

### Component: Data Storage Layer

#### Failure Mode Matrix

| Failure Mode | Severity | Occurrence | Detection | RPN | Priority |
|--------------|----------|------------|-----------|-----|----------|
| Primary DB crash | 9 | 2 | 2 | 36 | Medium |
| Replication lag > 5s | 6 | 4 | 3 | 72 | High |
| Backup corruption | 10 | 1 | 8 | 80 | High |

## 🌐 System-Level Failure Modes

### Cascading Failures

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Database Failure] --> B[Auth Service Down]
    B --> C[API Gateway Rejects All]
    A --> D[User Service Degraded]
    D --> E[Order Service Fails]
    E --> F[Inventory Desync]
    F --> G[Financial Reconciliation Issues]
```

### Critical Failure Chains
1. **Authentication Cascade**
   - JWT validation fails → All services reject requests → Complete outage
   - **Prevention**: Local token validation, grace period

2. **Payment Processing Chain**
   - Payment gateway timeout → Retry storm → Rate limit → Customer can't pay
   - **Prevention**: Circuit breaker, exponential backoff

3. **Data Consistency Chain**
   - Replication lag → Read stale data → Business logic error → Data corruption
   - **Prevention**: Read-after-write consistency, version checks

## 📊 Risk Assessment Matrix

### High-Priority Risks (RPN > 100)

  - name: "Database overload"
    condition: "db_connections > 90% AND query_time > 1s"
    action: "Redirect to read replica"

  - name: "Memory leak suspected"

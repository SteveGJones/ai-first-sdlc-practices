# AI-First SDLC Quick Start Guide

Get your project ready for AI-driven development in 5 minutes! üöÄ

## Prerequisites

- Git repository initialized
- Basic project structure in place
- Admin access to configure branch protection
- (Optional) GitHub CLI installed - setup will guide you through auth if needed

## Step 1: Copy Templates (1 minute)

```bash
# From your project root
mkdir -p docs/feature-proposals plan retrospectives

# Copy templates
cp path/to/ai-first-sdlc-framework/templates/CLAUDE.md .
cp path/to/ai-first-sdlc-framework/templates/feature-proposal.md docs/feature-proposals/
cp path/to/ai-first-sdlc-framework/templates/implementation-plan.md plan/
cp path/to/ai-first-sdlc-framework/templates/retrospective.md retrospectives/
```

## Step 2: Customize CLAUDE.md (2 minutes)

Edit `CLAUDE.md` in your project root:

1. **Update Project Overview** (line 7)
   ```markdown
   ## Project Overview
   This is a [your technology] project that [what it does].
   ```

2. **Add Build Commands** (line 106)
   ```bash
   # Your specific commands
   npm install    # or pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm test       # or pytest
   npm run build  # or make build
   ```

3. **Update File Structure** (line 83)
   ```
   src/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [your-structure]
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [your-folders]
   ```

## Step 3: Set Up Branch Protection (1 minute)

### GitHub (Automated with Setup)
```bash
# The setup script handles this automatically!
# If gh is installed but not authenticated, it will prompt you:
# "Would you like to authenticate now? [Y/n]:"

# Or manually run:
python tools/setup-branch-protection-gh.py
# This will also prompt for auth if needed

# Alternative - using token (less secure)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token
python tools/setup-branch-protection.py
```

### GitHub (Manual via UI)
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Enable:
   - ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews
   - ‚úÖ Dismiss stale reviews
   - ‚úÖ Include administrators
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks

### GitLab
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Protected branches
2. Select `main` branch
3. Set:
   - Allowed to merge: Maintainers
   - Allowed to push: No one

## Step 4: Create First Feature Proposal (1 minute)

```bash
# Create your first feature proposal
cp docs/feature-proposals/feature-proposal.md \
   docs/feature-proposals/01-initial-setup.md

# Edit the file
# - Set Target Branch: `feature/initial-setup`
# - Fill in feature details
```

## Step 5: Brief Your Team

### For AI Agents

Add to your AI agent's context:
```
Please read and follow CLAUDE.md in the project root.
Key rules:
1. Never push to main branch
2. Always create feature proposals
3. Always create retrospectives
```

### For Human Developers

Share this message:
```
We're adopting AI-First SDLC. Key changes:
1. All work requires feature branches (no direct main pushes)
2. Feature proposals required before implementation
3. Retrospectives required after completion
4. AI agents will be primary developers on some features

See CLAUDE.md for details.
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] CLAUDE.md exists in project root
- [ ] Branch protection enabled on main
- [ ] Template directories created
- [ ] First feature proposal created
- [ ] Team briefed on new workflow

## Next Steps

### Start Using the Framework

1. **For New Features**:
   ```bash
   # 1. Create proposal
   cp docs/feature-proposals/feature-proposal.md \
      docs/feature-proposals/02-your-feature.md
   
   # 2. Create branch (after proposal approved)
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   
   # 3. Implement (following CLAUDE.md)
   
   # 4. Create retrospective
   cp retrospectives/retrospective.md \
      retrospectives/your-feature-retrospective.md
   ```

2. **For AI Agents**:
   - Always provide CLAUDE.md in context
   - Monitor for compliance
   - Update instructions based on retrospectives

3. **For Complex Features**:
   - Use implementation plan template
   - Break into phases
   - Track progress with TODOs

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "AI agent pushed to main"
**Solution**: Strengthen CLAUDE.md language, add pre-push hooks

### "Feature proposal too detailed"
**Solution**: Remember proposals are for planning, not implementation

### "Retrospectives being skipped"
**Solution**: Make them part of PR merge checklist

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Check you're not on main
git branch --show-current

# Push to feature branch
git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# NEVER do this
git push origin main  # ‚ùå BLOCKED
```

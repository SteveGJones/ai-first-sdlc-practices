# What's New in AI-First SDLC Practices

## 🔥 Latest: v1.5.0 - Self-Review & Design Standards (July 2025)

### Major Features

**🔍 Self-Review Process (MANDATORY)**
- AI agents now review all artifacts before presenting to users
- Built into templates and workflow
- Improves quality by catching gaps early
- Completely internal - users only see polished results

**📐 Design Documentation Standards**
- Clear separation between design (WHAT/WHY) and implementation (HOW)
- New design documentation template
- Validation warns when design docs contain >20% code
- Prevents over-coding in design phase

### Quick Benefits
- **Quality**: Systematic review catches issues before user sees them
- **Clarity**: Design docs focus on requirements, not implementation
- **Validation**: Automated checks ensure standards are maintained

### How to Update
```bash
# Have Claude check for updates using the standard prompt:
cat docs/updates/UPDATE-PROMPT.md

# Or directly:
# 1. Check current: cat VERSION
# 2. Check latest: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/VERSION
# 3. Follow migration guide if update available
```

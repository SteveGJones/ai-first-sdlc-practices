## The Frontend Security Specialist Manifesto

"I am the guardian at the gates of user interaction. Every line of JavaScript I review, every security header I configure, every authentication flow I design is a shield protecting our users. I don't just prevent attacks; I create an environment where attacks cannot succeed. When hackers probe our defenses, they find not vulnerabilities but an impenetrable wall of well-designed security. My success is measured not in attacks blocked, but in attacks that never had a chance."

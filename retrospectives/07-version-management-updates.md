## What Went Well üü¢

### Planning Phase
1. **Clear Problem Definition**: Emerged from discussion about release notes
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Correctly identified as separate feature
3. **User Journey Mapping**: Considered both new and existing users
4. **Critical Insight**: User identified fundamental flaw in traditional approach
5. **Paradigm Shift**: Pivoted to AI-first update system

---

## What Could Be Improved üü°

[To be documented during implementation]

---

## What Went Wrong üî¥

[To be documented if issues arise]

---

## Key Learnings

### Requirements Gathering
1. **Feature Scope**: Version management is complex enough to warrant its own feature
2. **User Needs**: Different user types (new vs existing) have different needs
3. **Information Architecture**: Multiple touchpoints needed for discovery
4. **Paradigm Consistency**: Updates must maintain AI-first approach
5. **Critical Feedback**: "Using Python to EXECUTE rather than INFORM Claude"

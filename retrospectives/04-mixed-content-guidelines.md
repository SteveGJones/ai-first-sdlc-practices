# Feature Retrospective: Mixed Content Guidelines Addition

**Date:** 2025-07-17  
**Feature Branch:** `fix/post-merge-cleanup` (added to existing branch)  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Team Members:** Claude (AI Agent), Steve Jones (Human)  
**Facilitator:** Claude

## Executive Summary

Successfully added mixed content handling guidelines to the CLAUDE.md template based on real-world lessons learned from the agent-package-specification project. This quick enhancement addresses a critical gap where AI agents apply syntax from one code block type to another, breaking documentation.

---

## What Went Well ðŸŸ¢

1. **Quick Problem Recognition**: Immediately understood the value of these lessons for the framework
2. **Real-World Based**: Guidelines based on actual problems encountered, not theoretical
3. **Clear Examples**: Provided concrete examples of good vs bad approaches
4. **Followed Framework Process**: Created proper feature proposal despite being a small change

---

## What Could Be Improved ðŸŸ¡

1. **Branch Choice**: Added to existing cleanup branch instead of creating new feature branch
2. **Limited Scope**: Only updated template, didn't add to main CLAUDE.md
3. **No Validation Tools**: Just documentation, no automated checking yet

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Cross-Project Learning**: Lessons from one project can significantly improve the framework
2. **Documentation-First**: Adding guidelines prevents problems before they occur
3. **Context is Critical**: AI agents need explicit context about different content types

## Action Items

- [ ] Consider adding automated validation tools in future
- [ ] Add similar guidelines for other mixed content scenarios
- [ ] Create example repository showing common AI mistakes

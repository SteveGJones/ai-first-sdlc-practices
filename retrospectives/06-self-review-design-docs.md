# Feature Retrospective: Self-Review Process and Design Documentation Standards

**Date:** 2025-07-17  
**Feature Branch:** `feature/self-review-design-docs`  
**Duration:** [In Progress]  
**Team Members:** Claude (AI Agent), Steve Jones (Human)  
**Facilitator:** Claude

## Executive Summary

[To be completed: Implementation of self-review process and design documentation standards to address quality gaps and over-coding in design phases]

---

## Feature Overview

### Original Goal
Introduce mandatory self-review process for all artifacts and establish clear design documentation standards to prevent implementation code in design phases, based on successful patterns observed in other projects.

### What Was Delivered
[In Progress]

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Implementation Time | 2 days | [TBD] | ‚è≥ In Progress |
| Code in Design Docs | <20% | [TBD] | ‚è≥ To Measure |
| Review Efficiency | <5 min | [TBD] | ‚è≥ To Measure |
| Quality Improvement | Significant | [TBD] | ‚è≥ To Measure |

## What Went Well üü¢

### Planning Phase
1. **Clear Problem Definition**: User provided excellent context about both issues with specific examples
2. **Collaborative Refinement**: Interactive Q&A helped clarify requirements before implementation
3. **Unified Approach**: Recognized the connection between self-review and design quality
4. **Comprehensive Plan**: Created detailed feature proposal and implementation plan upfront

### Process Improvements
1. **Following Our Own Framework**: Created proposal, plan, and retrospective before coding
2. **Scope Management**: Decided on phased approach rather than everything at once

## What Could Be Improved üü°

[To be documented during implementation]

## What Went Wrong üî¥

[To be documented if issues arise]

## Key Learnings

### Requirements Gathering
1. **Ask First, Build Second**: The clarifying questions revealed important nuances:
   - Review should be invisible to users
   - Flexibility needed for diagram formats
   - Warnings not errors for code in design

2. **Real-World Validation**: These features come from actual project pain points, not theoretical concerns

### Framework Evolution
1. **Cultural Changes**: This feature requires changing how AI agents think about their work
2. **Balance**: Need to improve quality without adding bureaucracy

Perfect! Your vision combines task management with AI intelligence - that's ambitious and achievable.

Let me assemble your DREAM TEAM based on your vision:

== YOUR LEGENDARY TEAM ==

1. **ai-solution-architect** (critical priority)
   Role: AI system architecture and ML integration patterns
   Why needed: Your app combines traditional task management with AI predictions
   First question: "I need an architecture that handles task data AND ML predictions for delay forecasting. What patterns work for this hybrid system?"

2. **database-architect** (critical priority)  
   Role: Data modeling for tasks + ML feature engineering
   Why needed: AI predictions require well-structured data for training and inference
   First question: "I need to model tasks, user behavior, and project timelines for both app functionality AND ML training. How do I structure this data?"

3. **ux-ui-architect** (high priority)
   Role: User experience for AI-enhanced task management
   Why needed: Users need to understand and trust AI predictions
   First question: "How do I show users AI delay predictions in a way that's helpful, not overwhelming?"

4. **prompt-engineer** (high priority) 
   Role: Natural language interfaces for task creation/queries
   Why needed: AI-powered apps often benefit from natural language interaction
   First question: "I want users to create tasks naturally: 'Set up marketing campaign by Friday, high priority.' How do I design prompts for this?"

== WEEK 1 CHALLENGE: Team Assembly Exercise ==

üéØ **IMMEDIATE MISSION**: Pick your first feature and write the EXACT question you'd ask ai-solution-architect about it.

Feature suggestion: "Smart task prioritization that learns from user behavior"

Your turn! Write your specific question to ai-solution-architect. Remember:
- Be conversational ("I need..." not "Please design...")
- Include numbers/constraints (users, tasks, performance)
- Describe the business outcome you want

Ready? üëá

‚úÖ **Excellent Specificity**: You included concrete numbers (20 people, 200+ tasks)!
‚úÖ **Good Business Focus**: Learning from user behavior to help with priorities
‚úÖ **Conversational Tone**: Natural "I need..." approach
‚úÖ **Clear Outcome**: Automatic priority suggestions

üéâ **OUTSTANDING!** You're already thinking like a team conductor!

== NEXT CHALLENGE: The Handoff Practice ==

Now practice the handoff sequence:

1. ai-solution-architect gives you the ML architecture
2. You hand off to database-architect: "Based on the architecture, here's what we need for data..."
3. Then to ux-ui-architect: "We have the data model, now how do users see priority suggestions?"

Practice this conversation flow out loud!

EMERGENCY: Your AI task app is predicting wrong priorities! Users are angry.

Available team:

Write your coordination plan: What do you tell each agent? What's your sequence?

BEFORE (Solo Hero):
‚ùå "I'll design the database, create the UI, build the ML model..."
‚ùå Overwhelmed by complexity, mediocre results
‚ùå Takes 3 months, ships buggy product
‚ùå Users complain about poor experience

AFTER (Legendary Team Player):
‚úÖ "ai-solution-architect, what's the best ML architecture for this?"
‚úÖ Coordinates 5 specialists, excellent results  
‚úÖ Ships in 3 weeks with high quality
‚úÖ Users love the experience and AI predictions

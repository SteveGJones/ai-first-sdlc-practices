# Agentic SDLC Coaching System - Billy Wright Team Excellence + Stan Cullis Enforcement

## 🚀 The Kickoff Genius - Transform ANY Project in 5 Minutes

### For Third-Party AI Agents - Your Testing Prompt:

```bash
# From the PR branch, test the 5-minute miracle:
cd tools/coaching
python kickoff_genius.py "your vague project idea here"

# Examples:
python kickoff_genius.py "I want to build something with AI"
python kickoff_genius.py "need a way to track inventory"
python kickoff_genius.py "thinking about data analytics"
```

This will:
1. **MINUTE 1**: Transform vague idea → crystal clear vision
2. **MINUTE 2**: Assemble perfect AI agent team
3. **MINUTE 3**: Make all architecture decisions
4. **MINUTE 4**: Break down into actionable tasks
5. **MINUTE 5**: Launch execution with commands

## What This REALLY Is

Two revolutionary systems in one:

### 1. **Kickoff Genius** (`kickoff_genius.py`)
The Billy Wright 5-minute miracle that transforms chaos into coordinated excellence. From vague idea to actionable plan in 300 seconds.

### 2. **SDLC Enforcer** (`sdlc_coach.py`)
The Stan Cullis enforcement system that BLOCKS non-compliant work and enforces world-class standards

## How It Works

```bash
python sdlc_coach.py "your project description"
```

### What Happens:

1. **Feature Proposal** - BLOCKED without it
2. **Architecture Documents** - ALL 6 REQUIRED
3. **Zero Technical Debt** - NO TODOs, NO FIXMEs
4. **Agent Validation** - Verified team only
5. **Quality Gates** - Automatic enforcement
6. **Progress Tracking** - Continuous measurement
7. **Retrospective** - MANDATORY before PR

Only after ALL compliance checks pass can development begin.

## The Enforcement Flow

```
Project Start
    ↓
📋 Feature Proposal Required
    ↓ (BLOCKED if missing)
📐 Architecture Documents (6)
    ↓ (BLOCKED if incomplete)
🚫 Zero Technical Debt Check
    ↓ (BLOCKED if violations)
🤖 Agent Discovery & Validation
    ↓ (BLOCKED if invalid)
🚧 Quality Gates Setup
    ↓
📊 Progress Tracking Init
    ↓
📝 Retrospective Template
    ↓
✅ DEVELOPMENT AUTHORIZED
```

## Example Session

```bash
$ python sdlc_coach.py "build task management app"

AGENTIC SDLC COACH - ZERO TOLERANCE ENFORCEMENT
================================================================================

📋 STEP 1: Feature Proposal (MANDATORY)
----------------------------------------
❌ BLOCKED: Complete the feature proposal first

🚫🚫🚫🚫 DEVELOPMENT BLOCKED - NON-COMPLIANT 🚫🚫🚫🚫

NO SHORTCUTS. NO EXCEPTIONS. FIX IT OR DON'T DEVELOP.

Stan Cullis says: 'Standards aren't optional. Meet them or sit out.'
```

## What Gets Enforced

### 1. Documentation (MANDATORY)
- Feature proposal with all sections
- 6 architecture documents
- Retrospective (updated continuously)

### 2. Code Quality (ZERO TOLERANCE)
- NO `TODO` comments
- NO `FIXME` markers
- NO `any` types
- NO commented code
- NO missing error handling

### 3. Process (ENFORCED)
- Progress tracked for every task
- Validation after every change
- Quality gates at commit/push
- Retrospective before PR

### 4. Team Composition (VALIDATED)
- Agents must exist
- Roles must be appropriate
- Always includes enforcement agents:
  - `critical-goal-reviewer`
  - `project-plan-tracker`
  - Framework validators

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit (Every Change)
```bash
python tools/validation/local-validation.py --syntax
python tools/validation/check-technical-debt.py --threshold 0
```

### Pre-Push (Before Sharing)
```bash
python tools/validation/validate-pipeline.py --ci
python tools/validation/validate-architecture.py --strict
```

### Continuous (Always Running)
```bash
python tools/automation/progress-tracker.py list
python tools/validation/check-feature-proposal.py
```

## For AI Agents

This tool TEACHES you professional development by ENFORCING it:

1. **You CANNOT skip steps** - The tool blocks you
2. **You LEARN standards** - By being forced to meet them
3. **You BUILD habits** - Through repetition and enforcement
4. **You BECOME professional** - No other option given

## The Stan Cullis Philosophy

> "We don't suggest fitness levels, we demand them. We don't recommend tactics, we drill them. We don't hope for excellence, we enforce it."

This tool embodies that philosophy:
- **Demands** documentation
- **Drills** quality practices
- **Enforces** excellence

## The Billy Wright Leadership

> "Lead by example. Never ask the team to do what you won't do yourself."

This tool leads by example:
- Follows all framework standards
- Uses proper error handling
- Validates everything
- Documents thoroughly

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- AI-First SDLC framework installed
- All validation tools present

## No Compromises

This tool has **ZERO** options for:

- Bypassing validation
- Taking shortcuts

If you want suggestions without enforcement, this isn't your tool.

If you want to build PROFESSIONAL, WORLD-CLASS systems, welcome to the team.

## Installation

```bash
# Ensure framework is installed

## üéØ THE TACTICS - How We Play

### Build-Up Play (Feature Start)

```
Phase 1: Deep Build-Up
solution-architect ‚Üí database-architect ‚Üí api-architect
"I need X" ‚Üí "Store like this" ‚Üí "Access via these endpoints"

Phase 2: Progression
api-architect ‚Üí performance-engineer ‚Üí ux-ui-architect
"APIs ready" ‚Üí "Optimized for load" ‚Üí "User flows designed"

Phase 3: Final Third
ux-ui-architect ‚Üí frontend-engineer + backend-engineer
"Here's the design" ‚Üí "Implementing in parallel"

Phase 4: Finish
All ‚Üí ai-test-engineer
"Feature complete" ‚Üí "Validating all scenarios"
```

### Pressing Patterns (Problem Solving)

#### High Press (Catch Issues Early)
```
Trigger: New requirement
Response: solution-architect + security-specialist press immediately
Result: Problems caught before coding starts
```

#### Mid Press (Active Development)
```
Trigger: Integration challenges
Response: api-architect + devops-specialist coordinate press
Result: Deployment issues prevented
```

#### Low Block (Production Defense)
```
Trigger: Live issue
Response: All defenders (architect + database + api + security) form block
Result: System protected while fixing
```

### Set Pieces (Standard Scenarios)

#### Corner Kick (New Feature)
```
Taker: solution-architect
Target: database-architect (near post)
Runners: frontend/backend-engineers
Safety: security-specialist covers
```

#### Free Kick (Bug Fix)
```
Taker: ai-test-engineer (identifies issue)
Wall: security + performance (protect system)
Strike: backend-engineer (implements fix)
Rebound: frontend-engineer (UI updates)
```

#### Penalty (Critical Hotfix)
```
Taker: Most experienced specialist
Keeper: production environment
Pressure: High
Success Rate: Must be 100%
```

## üèÜ THE BILLY WRIGHT WAY - Leadership Principles

### 1. No Glory Seeking
```
‚ùå "I built this feature"
‚úÖ "The team delivered this feature"

‚ùå "My code is perfect"
‚úÖ "Let's review together for improvement"
```

### 2. Set Up Your Teammates
```
Good: solution-architect provides clear specs
Better: Also provides example implementations
Best: Provides specs, examples, and offers pairing
```

### 3. Lead by Example
```
When solution-architect collaborates well:
‚Üí database-architect follows pattern
‚Üí Team chemistry improves
‚Üí Legendary status achieved
```

### 4. Team First Mentality
```
Individual brilliance < Team coordination
Solo run < Team build-up
My success < Our success
```

## üéÆ THE COORDINATION PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: The Triangle (Basic)
```
      solution-architect
           /     \
          /       \
database-architect  api-architect
```
Quick passes between three players to maintain possession

### Pattern 2: The Diamond (Advanced)
```
        solution-architect
              |
      performance-engineer
           /     \
database-architect  api-architect
```
Four players creating passing options and overloads

### Pattern 3: The Overlap (Expert)
```
ux-ui-architect ‚Üí frontend-engineer ‚Üó
                                    ‚Üò
                                  backend-engineer
                                    ‚Üô
devops-specialist ‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üê‚Üô
```
Wide player overlaps to create 2v1 advantage

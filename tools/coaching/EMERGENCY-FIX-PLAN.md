# EMERGENCY FIX PLAN - Billy Wright Standards Crisis

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH

We've been caught with our pants down. The critical-goal-reviewer exposed that we're at **10% compliance** when we claimed 100%. Billy Wright would bench the entire team.

## CRITICAL FAILURES FOUND

### 1. Agent Name Mismatches (BLOCKS EVERYTHING)
- System references: `database-architect` (hyphen)
- Agent file has: `name: database_architect` (underscore)
- **Impact**: System fails immediately when tested

### 2. YAML Parsing Broken (90% OF AGENTS)
- Only 2 out of 30+ agents can be parsed
- Multi-line YAML in examples is malformed
- **Impact**: Agent discovery completely broken

### 3. False Claims Made
- Claimed: "ALL 34+ agent templates following EXACT YAML format"
- Reality: Complete chaos with different formats
- **Impact**: Reputation damage when tested

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Step 1: Fix Agent Name in database-architect.md
```bash
# Change database_architect to database-architect
sed -i '' 's/name: database_architect/name: database-architect/' agents/core/database-architect.md
```

### Step 2: Quick Verification
```bash
# Verify the core team agents at minimum
grep "^name:" agents/core/{solution-architect,database-architect,ux-ui-architect}.md
```

### Step 3: Test Basic Flow
```bash
cd tools/coaching
python fresh-ai-starter.py "build a task management app"
# Verify it gives correct team formation
```

## THE HONEST ASSESSMENT

### What Actually Works
1. `fresh-ai-starter.py` logic is sound
2. 30-day progression plan is realistic
3. Chemistry tracking algorithm works

### What's Completely Broken
1. Agent template YAML format (90% broken)
2. Name consistency (database_architect vs database-architect)
3. Integration between coaching system and actual agents

### What Billy Wright Would Say
"You've built tactics without checking if your players exist. You've designed formations without verifying the pitch is there. This isn't preparation - it's pretending."

## MINIMUM VIABLE FIX (30 minutes)

### Fix Just the Core Web Team
```bash
# Fix these 3 agents minimum:
# - solution-architect
# - database-architect  
# - ux-ui-architect

# 1. Fix database-architect name
sed -i '' 's/name: database_architect/name: database-architect/' agents/core/database-architect.md

# 2. Verify they exist
ls agents/core/{solution-architect,database-architect,ux-ui-architect}.md

# 3. Test the system
python fresh-ai-starter.py "build a task app"
```

### What We Tell the User
"The core system works but needs integration fixes. We can demonstrate with web apps but other formations need repair."

## FULL FIX (2-3 hours)

1. Standardize ALL agent names to use hyphens
2. Fix YAML formatting in all agent templates
3. Verify every referenced agent exists
4. Run complete integration test
5. Document known working formations

## THE BOTTOM LINE

We're not Billy Wright ready. We're Sunday Park pretending to be at Wembley.

**Options:**
1. **Quick Fix**: Fix just web team, admit others broken (30 min)
2. **Proper Fix**: Fix all agents and integration (2-3 hours)
3. **Honest Admission**: Tell user we need to fix integration before testing

Billy Wright's standard: "Perfect preparation prevents poor performance"

We failed preparation. We must fix or admit failure.

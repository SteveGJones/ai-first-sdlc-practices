### 4. Tactical Patterns

#### Consultation Pattern
```markdown
Before any decision:
1. Identify relevant agents
2. Ask specific questions
3. Wait for responses
4. Synthesize input
5. Document decision
```

#### Handoff Pattern
```markdown
Agent A completes work:
1. Document what's done
2. Identify next agent
3. Explain context
4. Define expectations
5. Transfer ownership
```

#### Crisis Pattern
```markdown
When problems arise:
1. Alert all agents
2. Diagnose together
3. Assign roles
4. Execute fix
5. Document lessons
```

### 5. Measurement System

#### Chemistry Score Components
- **Consultation Rate**: Questions asked per decision
- **Response Integration**: How well you use feedback
- **Handoff Clarity**: Quality of work transfer
- **Team Attribution**: Credit given to others
- **Crisis Coordination**: Performance under pressure

#### Progress Tracking
```python
{
    "day": 5,
    "chemistry_score": 65,
    "agents_coordinated": 5,
    "features_completed": 3,
    "solo_runs": 0,
    "team_consultations": 47,
    "crisis_responses": 2,
    "status": "on_track"
}
```

### 6. Required Implementation

#### Core Script: start-legendary-journey.py
```python
def start_journey(vision):
    # 1. Analyze vision
    team = map_vision_to_team(vision)
    
    # 2. Create coaching plan
    plan = create_14_day_plan(team)
    
    # 3. Initialize progress tracking
    progress = initialize_progress()
    
    # 4. Start Day 1
    start_day_1_coaching(team, plan)
    
    return journey_id
```

#### Daily Coach: daily-coaching.py
```python
def daily_coaching(journey_id, day):
    # 1. Load progress
    progress = load_progress(journey_id)
    
    # 2. Get today's exercises
    exercises = get_day_exercises(day)
    
    # 3. Run coaching session
    results = run_exercises(exercises)
    
    # 4. Update chemistry score
    chemistry = calculate_chemistry(results)
    
    # 5. Save progress
    save_progress(journey_id, day, chemistry)
```

#### Chemistry Calculator: chemistry-score.py
```python
def calculate_chemistry(behaviors):
    scores = {
        'consultation': count_consultations(behaviors),
        'handoffs': evaluate_handoffs(behaviors),
        'attribution': check_team_credit(behaviors),
        'solo_runs': detect_solo_decisions(behaviors),
        'coordination': assess_coordination(behaviors)
    }
    
    return weighted_average(scores)
```

## üö® What We Must Build NOW

### Priority 1: Entry Point
Create `start-legendary-journey.py` that actually works

### Priority 2: Daily Structure  
Implement all 14 days with specific exercises

### Priority 3: Working Tools
Fix the broken vision-to-team-mapper.py

### Priority 4: Progress Tracking
Create persistent state management

### Priority 5: Measurement
Implement real chemistry scoring

## Success Criteria

A fresh AI can:
1. Run ONE command to start
2. Follow CLEAR daily instructions
3. See MEASURABLE progress
4. Achieve LEGENDARY status in 14 days
5. Have PROOF of transformation

## The Bottom Line

**We have great ideas but incomplete execution.**

To make fresh AIs legendary, we need:
- Complete implementation (not documentation)
- Working tools (not concepts)
- Real coaching (not philosophy)
- Measurable progress (not claims)

**This is the COMPLETE plan. Now we need to BUILD it.**

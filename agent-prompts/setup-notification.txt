# AI Agent Configuration Instructions

## Important: Manual Agent Setup Required

The AI-First SDLC framework includes specialized AI agents that enhance your development workflow. However, these agents must be configured manually in your AI platform (Claude, GPT-4, etc.).

## Next Steps:

1. **Navigate to the agent-prompts directory:**
   ```
   cd agent-prompts/
   ```

2. **Review available agents:**
   ```
   cat README.md
   ```

3. **Configure essential agents** (recommended):
   - sdlc-coach (in core/)
   - solution-architect (in core/)
   - test-manager (in core/)
   - kickstart-architect (in sdlc/)

4. **For each agent:**
   - Open the .txt file
   - Follow the configuration instructions
   - Copy the prompt into your AI platform
   - Set the specified trigger words

## Quick Configuration Example:

For Claude:
1. Open Claude's agent configuration
2. Click "Create New Agent"
3. Name it according to the prompt file
4. Paste the prompt content
5. Set the trigger words
6. Save and test

## Why Manual Configuration?

AI platforms don't currently support programmatic agent creation for security and control reasons. Manual configuration ensures:
- You have full control over which agents are active
- You can customize agents for your specific needs
- You can verify agent behavior before activation

## Get Started:

Start with the core agents to experience the full power of AI-First SDLC:
```
cat agent-prompts/core/sdlc-coach.txt
cat agent-prompts/core/solution-architect.txt
cat agent-prompts/core/test-manager.txt
```

Happy coding with your new AI agent team!

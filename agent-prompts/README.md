# AI-First SDLC Agent Prompts

This directory contains prompts for manually configuring AI agents in Claude or other AI platforms. Since agents cannot be programmatically created, these prompts are designed for users to copy and paste into their AI platform's agent configuration interface.

## Quick Start

1. Choose the agents you need from the categories below
2. Open each `.txt` file for detailed configuration instructions
3. Follow the manual setup steps in your AI platform
4. Configure trigger words as specified in each prompt

## Manual Configuration Steps

Each agent prompt file contains:
1. **Configuration Instructions** - Step-by-step setup guide
2. **Trigger Words** - Keywords that activate the agent
3. **Agent Prompt** - The complete prompt to copy into your AI platform
4. **Example Interactions** - How the agent should respond

## Best Practices

### Agent Selection
- Start with core agents for any project
- Add specialized agents based on your needs
- Don't overload with too many agents initially

### Configuration Tips
- Set clear, unique trigger words for each agent
- Test agents after configuration
- Refine prompts based on actual usage
- Document any customizations you make

### Team Coordination
- Ensure all team members configure the same agents
- Share any prompt customizations
- Establish conventions for agent usage
- Regular reviews of agent effectiveness

## Integration with AI-First SDLC

These agents are designed to work together within the AI-First SDLC framework:

1. **Kickstart Phase**: Use `kickstart-architect` to set up projects
2. **Development Phase**: Leverage language experts and `solution-architect`
3. **Quality Phase**: Employ `test-manager` and testing agents
4. **Review Phase**: Use `retrospective-miner` for continuous improvement

## Customization

Feel free to customize these prompts for your specific needs:
- Add domain-specific knowledge
- Adjust communication style
- Include project-specific constraints
- Enhance with additional capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding
- Check trigger words are correctly configured
- Ensure the prompt was copied completely
- Verify no formatting issues in the paste

### Incorrect Behavior
- Review the agent's core responsibilities
- Check if customizations conflict with base behavior
- Test with simpler requests first

### Performance Issues
- Simplify complex prompts
- Break down large agents into smaller, focused ones
- Remove redundant instructions

## Contributing

To contribute new agent prompts:
1. Follow the existing format structure
2. Include clear configuration instructions
3. Provide example interactions
4. Test thoroughly before submitting

## Version Compatibility

These prompts are designed for:
- Claude 3.5+ (Optimized)
- GPT-4+ (Compatible)
- Other LLMs (May require adjustments)

Remember: The effectiveness of these agents depends on proper configuration and appropriate usage within the AI-First SDLC framework.
